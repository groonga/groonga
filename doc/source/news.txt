  [groonga-dev,02017] [Suggested by yoku]
* [doc] Added description about the value of lock timeout.
* Enabled ``GRN_JA_SKIP_SAME_VALUE_PUT`` by default. In the previous releases, the value of

* Added API to customize normalizer for snippet.

Fixes
^^^^^

* Fixed not to use index for empty query. This change enables you to search even though empty query.

.. _release-2-1-1:

Release 2.1.1 - 2012/12/29
--------------------------

This is bug fix release of 2.1.0. All of 2.1.0 users should use 2.1.1
instead.

Fixes
^^^^^

* Fixed a bug that ``KEY_NORMALIZE`` information in database that is
  created by groonga 2.0.8 or ealier is dropped.

.. _release-2-1-0:

Release 2.1.0 - 2012/12/29
--------------------------

.. Caution::

   Use 2.1.1 instead of 2.1.0. 2.1.0 has a serious bug related
   ``KEY_NORMALIZE``.

.. Caution::

   This release has backward incompatible changes against ``table_list`` and
   ``column_list`` commands. If you use own program which depends on the output
   results above commands, you need to support null instead of "null" string.

   This release has supported ``--normalizer`` option, but there is
   side effect for this feature. If you open old version of groonga
   database at least once, you can not open its database by old
   version of groonga.

   There is also another backward incompatible change agaist plugin API for
   tokenizer. The argument of ``grn_tokenizer_query_open`` API has changed.
   This API change affects developer of tokenizer plugin.

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* [doc] Added documentation about :ref:`nested-index-search`.
* Supported the expression as :doc:`/reference/functions/snippet_html` arguments.
  This change enables you to use ``snippet_html("STRING" + "STRING")`` for example.
  You can specify column name or literal for "STRING". [Reported by Tomoatsu Shimada]
* Supported to create own normalizer as a plugin.
* Moved ``groonga-query-log-analyzer`` as
  `groonga-query-log <http://rubygems.org/gems/groonga-query-log>`_ RubyGems.
  It enables you to analyze query logs without installing groonga package.
* Supported ``--normalizer`` option for :doc:`/reference/commands/table_create` command.
  This change enables you to specify normalizer plugin.
* Changed "null" string to null value as meaning for "No Object".
  This is backward incompatible change and affects output results of introspection
  related commands such as ``table_list`` and ``column_list``.
* Added a flag which controls behavior about normalizer as the last argument
  of ``grn_tokenizer_query_open`` API.
* Supported continuous line in :ref:`command-list-with-continuous-line` list.
* Improved to support not only no key table, but also hash table, patricia trie
  and double array trie for :ref:`nested-index-search`.

Fixes
^^^^^

* [windows] Added missing ``O_BINARY`` flag to open file correctly.
  This change fixes the infinite loop problem about groonga HTTP server.
  [GitHub#47] [Patch by Shimomura Tatsuya]
* Fixed a bug that ``--default-match-escalation-threshold`` doesn't accept
  negative value to disable functionality.
  This fix enable you to disable search escalation.
  see :option:`--default-match-escalation-threshold` about details.
* Fixed a bug that ``_score`` after "*" is ignored in ``--output_columns``.

  in ``geo_distance`` with ``rectangle`` as approximate type. [#1534]
* [doc] Added the :doc:`/spec/gqtp` specification.

  This change does not affects nomal use of groonga because it just checked whether default hostname
  is resolved in previous version.
* [experimental] Added ``snippet_html()`` function which extract keyword and surrounding text.
  See :doc:`/reference/functions/snippet_html` about details.
* Supported to report error reason when error occured during reading table record.
* Supported to search with keyword by nested index notation ( concatinate multiple 
  indexed column name with dot character ) if there is a relationship between
  multiple table with index.
* Supported to log "[tokenizer][mecab]" tag when using ``TokenMecab`` tokenizer.
* Supported to log "[tokenizer][kytea]" tag when using ``TokenKyTea`` tokenizer.
* Improved to use separated array for command error location as output results.
  This change is incompatibility change, but does not affects existing program.
