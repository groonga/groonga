Release 3.1.2 - 2014-01-29
--------------------------

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* [doc] Updated to caplitalized "Groonga" terms in documentation. [Patch by cosmo0920] [GitHub#136, #137, #138, #139, #140, #141, #142, #143, #144, #145, #146, #147, #148, #149, #150, #151]
* Supported to customize the value of lock timeout. See :doc:`/reference/api/global_configurations` about details.
  [groonga-dev,02017] [Suggested by yoku]
* [doc] Added description about the value of lock timeout.
* Enabled ``GRN_JA_SKIP_SAME_VALUE_PUT`` by default. In the previous releases, the value of
  this configuration is 'no'. This change affects reducing the size of Groonga database.
* Supported multiple indexes including a nested index and multiple keywords query.
  This change improves missing search results isssue when narrowing down by multiple keywords query.
* Added API to customize normalizer for snippet.

Fixes
^^^^^

* Fixed not to use index for empty query. This change enables you to search even though empty query.
  Note that this means that there is performance penalty if many empty records exist.
  [groonga-dev,02052] [Reported by Naoya Murakami]
* Fixed the behaviour about return value of "X || Y" and "X && Y" for adjusting to ECMAScript.
  In "X || Y" case, if either X or Y satisfy the condition, it returns X itself or Y itself instead of 1 or 0.
* In "X && Y" case, if X and Y satisfy the condition, it returns X itself instead of 1.
  if X doesn't satisfy the condition, it returns false instead of 0.
* Fixed to return null when no snippet is found. This change enables you to set the default value
  of :doc:`/reference/functions/snippet_html`. In such a purpose, use "snippet_html(XXX) || 'default value'".
