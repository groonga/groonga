### Fixes

#### {doc}`/reference/columns/index`: Fixed an {ref}`offline-index-construction` bug

Groonga may ignore options of normalizers, tokenizer and/or token filters in the target index when offline index construction is executed in parallel.

This issue may occur when:
- Offline index construction is executed in parallel.
- {doc}`/reference/normalizers`, {doc}`/reference/tokenizers`, or {doc}`/reference/token_filters` options are used.

However, if we use NormalizerTable, offline index construction occurs error by this issue.

## Release 15.0.1 - 2025-02-20

### Improvements

#### [{doc}`/install/ubuntu`] Dropped support for Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa)

Ubuntu 20.04 will reach EOL in May 2025, so support for it has been dropped
starting with this release.

(release-15-0-0)=
## Release 15.0.0 - 2025-02-09
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

This is our annual major release! This release doesn't have any
backward incompatible changes! So you can upgrade Groonga without
migrating your existing databases. You can still use your existing
databases as-is.

### Improvements

#### {ref}`table-pat-key`: Added support for {ref}`builtin-type-float32` as key type

[GH-2211](https://github.com/groonga/groonga/issues/2211)

{ref}`table-pat-key` encodes/decodes numeric keys for fast search
internally. So {ref}`table-pat-key` must know how to encode/decode
keys. {ref}`table-pat-key` didn't know how to encode/decode
{ref}`builtin-type-float32` before this release. Now,
{ref}`table-pat-key` can encode/decode {ref}`builtin-type-float32`. So
you can use {ref}`builtin-type-float32` as a {ref}`table-pat-key` key
type like other numeric types such as {ref}`builtin-type-int32` and
{ref}`builtin-type-float` now.
