## Release 15.0.0 - 2025-02-09
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

This is our annual major release! This release doesn't have any
backward incompatible changes! So you can upgrade Groonga without
migrating your existing databases. You can still use your existing
databases as-is.

### Improvements

#### {ref}`table-pat-key`: Added support for {ref}`builtin-type-float32` as key type

[GH-2211](https://github.com/groonga/groonga/issues/2211)

{ref}`table-pat-key` encodes/decodes numeric keys for fast search
internally. So {ref}`table-pat-key` must know how to encode/decode
keys. {ref}`table-pat-key` didn't know how to encode/decode
{ref}`builtin-type-float32` before this release. Now,
{ref}`table-pat-key` can encode/decode {ref}`builtin-type-float32`. So
you can use {ref}`builtin-type-float32` as a {ref}`table-pat-key` key
type like other numeric types such as {ref}`builtin-type-int32` and
{ref}`builtin-type-float` now.
