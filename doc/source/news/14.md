記載中：（4/8までの変更はピックアップ済み）

### Improvements

* show ID of dangling reference

  元々どんな時にでるログで、なんの情報を追加したのか。追加し情報はなんの役に立つのかを記載。
  [column][remove][index] hook has a dangling reference: <Users.name> -> <Terms.index>(259)"

* disable an optimization for large result set and GRN_OP_AND

  どういうケースで速くなるのかを記載。注意点があるならそれも記載。
  It's faster than the normal operation when result set doesn't have many records. But it's slower than the normal operation when result set has many records. We don't use this optimization for the latter case.

* AND search optimization.

  どういうケースで速くなるのかを記載。注意点があるならそれも記載。
  If we need to delete records from result set by GRN_OP_AND, we need to call grn_table_delete_prepare() many times. It has GRN_HASH_EACH_BEGIN/END loop for all columns of a
  result set. If the result set has no columns, we don't need to open empty cursors for many record deletions.

* prefix search optimization.

  どういうケースで速くなるのかを記載。注意点があるならそれも記載。
  If we don't create intermediate table, it improves performance.
  Note that this may change returned matched records order. But it's acceptable. Because the order is undefined. If users want stable ordered result, they need to sort the result explicitly.

* optimize large result set case

  どういうケースで速くなるのかを記載。注意点があるならそれも記載。
  "A AND B" and update "A" may be a heavy process when "A" has many records and B has a few records. This changes it to "B AND A" and update "B".
  This change is faster because we don't need to remove many records from "A". We just need to remove a few records from "B".


### Fixes

* [{doc}`/reference/commands/request_cancel`] Fix a crash bug when we execute `request_cancel` command whlie we execute the other query.

  request_cancelでクエリーを中断するとクラッシュすることがある問題を修正したことを記載。

* supress grn_output_range_normalize failed

  filter後に範囲外のpost-filterを実行するとエラー応答になる問題を修正したことを記載。具体例もつける。


(release-14-0-2)=
## Release 14.0.2 - 2024-03-29

### Improvements

* Reduced a log level of a log when Groonga setting normalizers/tokenizer/token_filters against temporary table.

  For example, the target log of this modification is the following log.

  ```
  DDL:1234567890:set_normalizers NormalizerAuto
  ```

  PGroonga sets normalizers against temporary table on start. So, this log becomes noise.
  Because this log become output when PGroonga start because of PGroonga's default log level is `notice`.

  Therefore, we reduce log level to `debug` for the log since this release.
  Thus, this log does not output when PGroonga start in default.

(release-14-0-1)=
## Release 14.0.1 - 2024-03-14

### Improvements

* [{doc}`/reference/commands/load`] Stopped reporting an error when we `load` key that becomes an empty key by normalization.

  `"-"` becomes `""` with `NormalizerNFKC150("remove_symbol", true)`. So the following case reports a "empty key" error.

  ```
  table_create Values TABLE_HASH_KEY ShortText \
    --normalizers 'NormalizerNFKC150("remove_symbol", true)'
  table_create Data TABLE_NO_KEY
  column_create Data value COLUMN_SCALAR Values
  load --table Data
  [
  {"value": "-"}
  ]
  ```

  However, if we many `load` in such data, many error log are generated.
  Because Groonga output many "empty key" error because of Groonga can't register empty string to index.

  No problem even if empty string can't register to index in such case.
  Because we don't match anything even if we search by empty string. So, we stop reporting an "empty key" error in such case.

### Fixes

* Fixed a crash bug if a request is canceled {doc}`/reference/functions/between` or range search.

  This bug doesn't necessarily occur. This bug occur when we cancel a request in the specific timing.
  This bug occur easily when search time is long such as sequential search.

* Fixed a bug that {doc}`/reference/functions/highlight_html` may return invalid result when the following conditions are met.

  * We use multiple normalizers such as `NormalizerTable` and `NormalizerNFKC150`.
  * We highlight string include whitespace.

  For example, this bug occur such as the following case.

  ```
  table_create NormalizationsIndex TABLE_PAT_KEY ShortText --normalizer NormalizerAuto

  table_create Normalizations TABLE_HASH_KEY UInt64
  column_create Normalizations normalized COLUMN_SCALAR LongText
  column_create Normalizations target COLUMN_SCALAR NormalizationsIndex

  column_create NormalizationsIndex index COLUMN_INDEX Normalizations target


  table_create Lexicon TABLE_PAT_KEY ShortText \
    --normalizers 'NormalizerTable("normalized", \
                                   "Normalizations.normalized", \
                                   "target", \
                                   "target"), NormalizerNFKC150'

  table_create Names TABLE_HASH_KEY UInt64
  column_create Names name COLUMN_SCALAR Lexicon

  load --table Names
  [
  ["_key","name"],
  [1,"Sato Toshio"]
  ]

  select Names \
    --query '_key:1 OR name._key:@"Toshio"' \
    --output_columns 'highlight_html(name._key, Lexicon)

          "sato <span class=\"keyword\">toshi</span>o"
        ]
      ]
    ]
  ]
  ```

* [{doc}`/install/ubuntu`] We become able to provide package for Ubuntu again.

  We don't provide packages for Ubuntu in Groonga version 14.0.0.
  Because we fail makeing Groonga package for Ubuntu by problrm of build environment for Ubuntu package.

  We fixed problrm of build environment for Ubuntu package in 14.0.1. So, we can provide packages for Ubuntu again since this release.

* Fixed build error when we build from source by using [`clang`](https://clang.llvm.org/). [GitHub#1738][Reported by windymelt]

## Release 14.0.0 - 2024-02-29

This is a major version up!
But It keeps backward compatibility. We can upgrade to 14.0.0 without rebuilding database.

### Improvements

* Added a new tokenizer `TokenH3Index` (experimental).

  `TokenH3Index`tokenizes WGS84GetPoint to UInt64(H3 index).

* Added support for offline and online index construction with non text based tokenizer (experimental).

  `TokenH3Index` is one of non text based tokenizers.

* [{doc}`/reference/commands/select`] Added support for searching by index with non text based tokenizer (experimental).

  `TokenH3Index` is one of non text based tokenizers.

* Added new functions `distance_cosine()`, `distance_inner_product()`, `distance_l2_norm_squared()`, `distance_l1_norm()`.

  We can only get records that a small distance as vector with these functions and `limit N`

  These functions calculate distance in the `output` stage.

  However, we don't optimaize these functions yet.

  * `distance_cosine()`: Calculate cosine similarity.
  * `distance_inner_product()`: Calculate inner product.
  * `distance_l2_norm_squared()`: Calculate euclidean distance.
  * `distance_l1_norm()`: Calculate manhattan distance.

* Added a new function `number_round()`.

* [{doc}`/reference/commands/load`] Added support for parallel `load`.

  This feature only enable when the `input_type` of `load` is `apache-arrow`.

  This feature one thread per column. If there are many target columns, it will reduce load time.

* [{doc}`/reference/commands/select`] We can use uvector as much as possible for array literal in `--filter`.

  uvector is vector of elements with fix size.

  If all elements have the same type, we use uvector instead vector.

* [{doc}`/reference/commands/status`] Added `n_workers` to output of `status`.

* Optimized a dynamic column creation.

* [WAL] Added support for rebuilding broken indexes in parallel.

* [{doc}`/reference/commands/select`] Added support for `Int64` in `output_type=apache-arrow` for columns that reference other table.

### Fixes

* [Windows] Fixed path for documents of `groonga-normalizer-mysql` in package for Windows.

  Documents of `groonga-normalizer-mysql` put under the `share/` in this release.

* [{doc}`/reference/commands/select`] Fixed a bug that Groonga may crash when we use bitwise operations.
