# News - 14 series

## Release 14.0.1 - 2024-03-14

### Fixes

* Fixed a crash bug if a request is canceled {doc}`/reference/functions/between` or range search.

  This bug doesn't necessarily occur. This bug occur when we cancel a request in the specific timing.
  This bug occur easily when search time is long such as sequential search.

* Fixed a bug that {doc}`/reference/functions/highlight_html` may return invalid result when the following conditions are met.

  * We use multiple normalizers such as NormalizerTable and NormalizerNFKC150.
  * We highlight string include whitespace.

  For example, this bug occur such as the following case.

  ```
  table_create NormalizationsIndex TABLE_PAT_KEY ShortText --normalizer NormalizerAuto

  table_create Normalizations TABLE_HASH_KEY UInt64
  column_create Normalizations normalized COLUMN_SCALAR LongText
  column_create Normalizations target COLUMN_SCALAR NormalizationsIndex

  column_create NormalizationsIndex index COLUMN_INDEX Normalizations target


  table_create Lexicon TABLE_PAT_KEY ShortText \
    --normalizers 'NormalizerTable("normalized", \
                                   "Normalizations.normalized", \
                                   "target", \
                                   "target"), NormalizerNFKC150'

  table_create Names TABLE_HASH_KEY UInt64
  column_create Names name COLUMN_SCALAR Lexicon

  load --table Names
  [
  ["_key","name"],
  [1,"Sato Toshio"]
  ]

  select Names \
    --query '_key:1 OR name._key:@"Toshio"' \
    --output_columns 'highlight_html(name._key, Lexicon)

## Release 14.0.0 - 2024-02-29

This is a major version up!
But It keeps backward compatibility. We can upgrade to 14.0.0 without rebuilding database.

### Improvements

* Added a new tokenizer `TokenH3Index` (experimental).

  `TokenH3Index`tokenizes WGS84GetPoint to UInt64(H3 index).

* Added support for offline and online index construction with non text based tokenizer (experimental).

  `TokenH3Index` is one of non text based tokenizers.

* [{doc}`/reference/commands/select`] Added support for searching by index with non text based tokenizer (experimental).

  `TokenH3Index` is one of non text based tokenizers.

* Added new functions `distance_cosine()`, `distance_inner_product()`, `distance_l2_norm_squared()`, `distance_l1_norm()`.

  We can only get records that a small distance as vector with these functions and `limit N`

  These functions calculate distance in the `output` stage.

  However, we don't optimaize these functions yet.

  * `distance_cosine()`: Calculate cosine similarity.
  * `distance_inner_product()`: Calculate inner product.
  * `distance_l2_norm_squared()`: Calculate euclidean distance.
  * `distance_l1_norm()`: Calculate manhattan distance.

* Added a new function `number_round()`.

* [{doc}`/reference/commands/load`] Added support for parallel `load`.

  This feature only enable when the `input_type` of `load` is `apache-arrow`.

  This feature one thread per column. If there are many target columns, it will reduce load time.

* [{doc}`/reference/commands/select`] We can use uvector as much as possible for array literal in `--filter`.

  uvector is vector of elements with fix size.

  If all elements have the same type, we use uvector instead vector.

* [{doc}`/reference/commands/status`] Added `n_workers` to output of `status`.

* Optimized a dynamic column creation.

* [WAL] Added support for rebuilding broken indexes in parallel.

* [{doc}`/reference/commands/select`] Added support for `Int64` in `output_type=apache-arrow` for columns that reference other table.

### Fixes

* [Windows] Fixed path for documents of `groonga-normalizer-mysql` in package for Windows.

  Documents of `groonga-normalizer-mysql` put under the `share/` in this release.

* [{doc}`/reference/commands/select`] Fixed a bug that Groonga may crash when we use bitwise operations.
