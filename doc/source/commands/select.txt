select
======

Summary
-------

``select`` searches records that are matched to specified conditions
from a table and then outputs them.

``select`` is the most important command in groonga. You need to
understand ``select`` to use the full power of groonga.

Syntax
------

``select`` has many parameters. The required parameter is only
``table`` and others are optional::

  select table
         [match_columns=null]
         [query=null]
         [filter=null]
         [scorer=null]
         [sortby=null]
         [output_columns="_id, _key, *"]
         [offset=0]
         [limit=10]
         [drilldown=null]
         [drilldown_sortby=null]
         [drilldown_output_columns=null]
         [drilldown_offset=0]
         [drilldown_limit=10]
         [cache=yes]
         [match_escalation_threshold=0]
         [query_expansion=null]

Usage
-----

Let's learn about ``select`` usage with examples. This section shows
many popular usages.

Here are a schema definition and sample data to show usage.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/commands/select/usage_setup.log
.. table_create Entries TABLE_HASH_KEY ShortText
.. column_create Entries content COLUMN_SCALAR Text
.. column_create Entries n_likes COLUMN_SCALAR UInt32
.. table_create Terms TABLE_PAT_KEY|KEY_NORMALIZE ShortText --default_tokenizer TokenBigram
.. column_create Terms entries_key_index COLUMN_INDEX|WITH_POSITION Entries _key
.. column_create Terms entries_content_index COLUMN_INDEX|WITH_POSITION Entries content
.. load --table Entries
.. [
.. {"_key":    "The first post!",
..  "content": "Welcome! This is my first post!",
..  "n_likes": 5},
.. {"_key":    "Groonga",
..  "content": "I started to use groonga. It's very fast!",
..  "n_likes": 10},
.. {"_key":    "Mroonga",
..  "content": "I also started to use mroonga. It's also very fast! Really fast!",
..  "n_likes": 15},
.. {"_key":    "Good-bye Senna",
..  "content": "I migrated all Senna system!",
..  "n_likes": 3},
.. {"_key":    "Good-bye Tritonn",
..  "content": "I also migrated all Tritonn system!",
..  "n_likes": 3}
.. ]

There is a table, ``Entries``, for blog entries. An entry has title,
content and the number of likes for the entry. Title is key of
``Entries``. Content is value of ``Entries.content`` column. The
number of likes is value of ``Entries.n_likes`` column.

``Entries._key`` column and ``Entries.content`` column are indexed
using ``TokenBigram`` tokenizer. So both ``Entries._key`` and
``Entries.content`` are fulltext search ready.

OK. The schema and data for examples are ready.

Simple usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here is the most simple usage with the above shema and data. It outputs
all records in ``Entries`` table.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/commands/select/simple_usage.log
.. select Entries

Why does the command output all records? There are two reasons. The
first reason is that the command doesn't specify any search
conditions. No search condition means all records are matched. The
second reason is that the number of all records is 3. ``select``
command outputs 10 records at a maximum by default. There are only 3
records. It is less than 10. So the command outputs all records.

Search conditions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Search conditions are specified by ``query`` or ``filter``. You can
also specify both ``query`` and ``filter``. It means that selected
records must be matched against both ``query`` and ``filter``.

Search condition: ``query``
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

``query`` is designed for search box in Web page. Imagine a search box
in google.com. You specify search conditions for ``query`` as space
separated keywords. For example, ``search engine`` means a matched
record should contain two words, ``search`` and ``engine``.

Normally, ``query`` parameter is used for specifying fulltext search
conditions. It can be used for non fulltext search conditions but
``filter`` is used for the propose.

``query`` parameter is used with ``match_columns`` parameter when
``query`` parameter is used for specifying fulltext search
conditions. ``match_columns`` specifies which columnes and indexes are
matched against ``query``.

Here is a simple ``query`` usage example.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/commands/select/simple_query.log
.. select Entries --match_columns content --query fast

The ``select`` command searches records that contain a word ``fast``
in ``content`` column value from ``Entries`` table.

``query`` has query syntax but its deatils aren't described here. See
:doc:`/spec/query_syntax` for datails.

Search condition: ``filter``
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

``filter`` is designed for complex search conditions. You specify
search conditions for ``filter`` as ECMAScript like syntax.

Here is a simple ``filter`` usage example.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/commands/select/simple_filter.log
.. select Entries --filter 'content @ "fast" && _key == "Groonga"'

The ``select`` command searches records that contain a word ``fast``
in ``content`` column value and has ``Groonga`` as ``_key`` from
``Entries`` table. There are three operators in the command, ``@``,
``&&`` and ``==``. ``@`` is fulltext search operator. ``&&`` and
``==`` are the same as ECMAScript. ``&&`` is logical AND operator and
``==`` is equality operator.

``filter`` has more operators and syntax like grouping by ``(...)``
its deatils aren't described here. See :doc:`/spec/script_syntax` for
datails.

Paging
^^^^^^

You can specify range of outputted records by ``offset`` and ``limit``.
Here is an example to output only the 2nd record.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/commands/select/paging.log
.. select Entries --offset 1 --limit 1

``offset`` is zero-origin. ``--offset 1`` means output range is
started from the 2nd record.

``limit`` specifies the max number of output records. ``--limit 1``
means the number of output records is 1 at a maximium. If no records
are matched, ``select`` command outputs no records.

The total number of records
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use ``--limit 0`` to retrieve the total number of recrods
without any contents of records.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/commands/select/no_limit.log
.. select Entries --limit 0

``--limit 0`` is also useful for retrieving only the number of matched
records.

Parameters
----------

This section describes all parameters. Parameters are categorized.

Required parameter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is a required parameter, ``table``.

``table``
"""""""""

It specifies a table to be searched. ``table`` must be specified.

If nonexistent table is specified, an error is returned.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/commands/select/table_nonexistent.log
.. select Nonexistent

Search related parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are search related parameters. Typically, ``match_columns`` and
``query`` parameters are used for implementing a search
box. ``filter`` parameters is used for implementing complex search
feature.

If both ``query`` and ``filter`` are specified, selected records must
be matched against both ``query`` and ``filter``. If both ``query``
and ``filter`` aren't specified, all records are selected.

``match_columns``
"""""""""""""""""

It specifies the default target column for fulltext search by
``query`` parameter value. A target column for fulltext search can be
specified in ``query`` parameter. The difference between
``match_columns`` and ``query`` is whether weight is supported or
not. ``match_columns`` supports weight but ``query`` doesn't.

Weight is relative importance of target column. A higher weight target
column gets more hit score rather than a lower weight target column
when a record is matched by fulltext search. The default weight is 1.

Here is a simple ``match_columns`` usage example.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/commands/select/match_columns_simple.log
.. select Entries --match_columns content --query fast --output_columns '_key, _score'

``--match_columns content`` means the default target column for
fulltext search is ``content`` column and its weight
is 1. ``--output_columns '_key, _score'`` means that the ``select``
command outputs ``_key`` value and ``_score`` value for matched
records.

Pay attention to ``_score`` value. ``_score`` value is the number of
matched counts against ``query`` parameter value. In the example,
``query`` parameter value is ``fast``. The fact that ``_score`` value
is 1 means that ``fast`` appers in ``content`` column only once.  The
fact that ``_score`` value is 2 means that ``fast`` appears in
``content`` column twice.

To specify weight, ``column * weight`` syntax is used. Here is a
weight usage example.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/commands/select/match_columns_weight.log
.. select Entries --match_columns 'content * 2' --query fast --output_columns '_key, _score'

``--match_columns 'content * 2'`` means the default target column for
fulltext search is ``content`` column and its weight is 2.

Pay attention to ``_score`` value. ``_score`` value is doubled because
weight is 2.

You can specify one or more columns as the default target columns for
fulltext search. If one or more columns are specified, fulltext search
is done for all columns and scores are accumulated. If one of the
columns is matched against ``query`` parameter value, the record is
treated as matched.

To specify one or more columns, ``column1 * weight1 || column2 *
weight2 || ...`` syntax is used. ``* weight`` can be omitted. If it is
omitted, 1 is used for weight. Here is a one or more columns usage
example.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/commands/select/match_columns_some_columns.log
.. select Entries --match_columns '_key * 10 || content' --query groonga --output_columns '_key, _score'

``--match_columns '_key * 10 || content'`` means the default target
columns for fulltext search are ``_key`` and ``content`` columns and
``_key`` column's weight is 10 and ``content`` column's weight
is 1. This weight allocation means ``_key`` column value is more
important rather than ``content`` column value. In this example, title
of blog entry is more important rather thatn content of blog entry.

``query``
"""""""""

It specifies the query text. Normally, it is used for fulltext search
with ``match_columns`` parameter. ``query`` parameter is designed for
a fulltext search form in a Web page. A query text should be formated
in :doc:`/spec/query_syntax`. The syntax is similar to common search
form like Google's search form. For example, ``query1 query2`` means
that matched records must contain both ``query1`` and
``query2``. ``query1 OR query2`` means that matched records must
contain either ``query1`` or ``query2``.

Here is a simple logical and search example.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/commands/select/query_and.log
.. select Entries --match_columns content --query "fast groonga"

The ``select`` command searches records that contain two words
``fast`` and ``groonga`` in ``content`` column value from ``Entries``
table.

Here is a simple logical or search example.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/commands/select/query_or.log
.. select Entries --match_columns content --query "groonga OR mroonga"

The ``select`` command searches records that contain one of two words
``groonga`` or ``mroonga`` in ``content`` column value from
``Entries`` table.

See :doc:`/spec/query_syntax` for other syntax.

It can be used for not only fulltext search but also other
conditions. For example, ``column:value`` means the value of
``column`` column is equal to ``value``. ``column:<value`` means the
value of ``column`` column is less than ``value``.

Here is a simple equality operator search example.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/commands/select/query_equal.log
.. select Entries --query _key:Groonga

The ``select`` command searches records that ``_key`` column value is
``Groonga`` from ``Entries`` table.

Here is a simple less than operator search example.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/commands/select/query_less_than.log
.. select Entries --query n_likes:<11

The ``select`` command searches records that ``n_likes`` column value
is less than ``11`` from ``Entries`` table.

See :doc:`/spec/query_syntax` for other operations.

``filter``
""""""""""

It specifies the filter text. Normally, it is used for complex search
conditions. ``filter`` can be used with ``query`` parameter. If both
``filter`` and ``query`` are specified, there are conbined with
logical and. It means that matched records should be matched against
both ``filter`` and ``query``.

``filter`` parameter is designed for complex conditions. A filter text
should be formated in :doc:`/spec/script_syntax`. The syntax is
similar to ECMAScript. For example, ``column == "value"`` means that
the value of ``column`` column is equal to ``"value"``. ``column <
value`` means that the value of ``column`` column is less than
``value``.

Here is a simple equality operator search example.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/commands/select/filter_equal.log
.. select Entries --filter '_key == "Groonga"'

The ``select`` command searches records that ``_key`` column value is
``Groonga`` from ``Entries`` table.

Here is a simple less than operator search example.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/commands/select/filter_less_than.log
.. select Entries --filter 'n_likes < 11'

The ``select`` command searches records that ``n_likes`` column value
is less than ``11`` from ``Entries`` table.

See :doc:`/spec/script_syntax` for other operators.

Advanced search parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``match_escalation_threshold``
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

It specifies threshold to determine whether search storategy
escalation is used or not. The threshold is compared against the
number of matched records. If the number of matched records is equal
to or less than the threshold, the search storategy escalation is
used. See :doc:`/spec/search` about the search storategy escalation.

The default threshold is 0. It means that search storategy escalation
is used only when no records are matched.

The default threshold can be customized by one of the followings.

  * ``--with-match-escalation-threshold`` option of configure
  * ``--match-escalation-threshold`` option of groogna command
  * ``match-escalation-threshold`` configuration item in configuration
    file

Here is a simple ``match_escalation_threshold`` usage example. The
first ``select`` doesn't have ``match_escalation_threshold``
parameter. The second ``select`` has ``match_escalation_threshold``
parameter.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/commands/select/match_escalation_threshold.log
.. select Entries --match_columns content --query groo
.. select Entries --match_columns content --query groo --match_escalation_threshold -1

The first ``select`` command searches records that contain a word
``groo`` in ``content`` column value from ``Entries`` table. But no
records are matched because the ``TokenBigram`` tokenizer tokenizes
``groonga`` to ``groonga`` not ``gr|ro|oo|on|ng|ga``. (The
``TokenBigramSplitSymbolAlpha`` tokenizer tokenizes ``groonga`` to
``gr|ro|oo|on|ng|ga``. See :doc:`/tokenizers` for details.) It means
that ``groonga`` is indexed but ``groo`` isn't indexed. So no records
are matched against ``groo`` by exact match. In the case, the search
storategy escalation is used because the number of matched records (0)
is equal to ``match_escalation_threshold`` (0). One record is matched
against ``groo`` by unsplit search.

The second ``select`` command also searches records that contain a
word ``groo`` in ``content`` column value from ``Entries`` table. And
it also doesn't found matched records. In this case, the search
storategy escalation is not used because the number of matched
records (0) is larger than ``match_escalation_threshold`` (-1). So no
more searches aren't executed. And no records are matched.

``query_expansion``
"""""""""""""""""""

It's for query expansion. Query expansion substitutes specific words
to another words in query. Nomally, it's used for synonym search.

It specifies a column that is used to substitute ``query`` parameter
value. The format of this parameter value is
"``${TABLE}.${COLUMN}``". For example, "``Terms.synonym``" specifies
``synonym`` column in ``Terms`` table.

Table for query expansion is called "substitution table". Substitution
table's key must be ``ShortText``. So array table (``TABLE_NO_KEY``)
can't be used for query expansion. Because array table doesn't have
key.

Column for query expansion is called "substitution
column". Substitution column's value type must be
``ShortText``. Column type must be vector (``COLUMN_VECTOR``). Key of
substitution table in query is substituted with values in substitution
column.

If a word in ``query`` is a key of substitution table, the word is
substituted with substitution column value that is associated with the
key. Substition isn't performed recursively. It means that
substitution target words in substituted query aren't substituted.

Here is a sample substitution table to show a simple
``query_expansion`` usage example.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/commands/select/query_expansion_substitution_table.log
.. table_create Thesaurus TABLE_PAT_KEY|KEY_NORMALIZE ShortText
.. column_create Thesaurus synonym COLUMN_VECTOR ShortText
.. load --table Thesaurus
.. [
.. {"_key": "mroonga", "synonym": ["mroonga", "tritonn", "groonga mysql"]},
.. {"_key": "groonga", "synonym": ["groonga", "senna"]}
.. ]

``Thesaurus`` substitution table has two synonyms, ``"mroonga"`` and
``"groonga"``. If an user searches with ``"mroonga"``, groonga
searches with ``"((mroonga) OR (tritonn) OR (groonga mysql))"``. If an
user searches with ``"groonga"``, groonga searchs with ``"((groonga)
OR (senna))"``. Nomrally, it's good idea that substitution table has
``KEY_NORMALIZE`` flag. If the flag is used, substitute target word is
matched in case insensitive manner.

Note that those synonym values include the key value such as
``"mroonga"`` and ``"groonga"``. It's recommended that you include the
key value. If you don't include key value, substituted value doesn't
include the original substuted value. Normally, including the original
value is better search result. If you have a word that you don't want
to be searched, you should not include the original word. For example,
you can implement "stop words" by an empty vector value.

Here is a simple ``query_expansion`` with substitution column
usage example.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/commands/select/query_expansion_substitute.log
.. select Entries --match_columns content --query "mroonga"
.. select Entries --match_columns content --query "mroonga" --query_expansion Thesaurus.synonym
.. select Entries --match_columns content --query "((mroonga) OR (tritonn) OR (groonga mysql))"

The first ``select`` command doesn't use query expansion. So a record
that has ``"tritonn"`` isn't found. The second ``select`` command uses
query expansion. So a record that has ``"tritonn"`` is found. The
third ``select`` command doesn't use query expansion but it is same as
the second ``select`` command. The third one uses expanded query.

Each substitute value can contain any :doc:`/spec/query_syntax` syntax
such as ``(...)`` and ``OR``. You can use complex substitution by
using those syntax.

Here is a complex substitution usage example that uses query syntax.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/commands/select/query_expansion_complex.log
.. load --table Thesaurus
.. [
.. {"_key": "popular", "synonym": ["popular", "n_likes:>=10"]}
.. ]
.. select Entries --match_columns content --query "popular" --query_expansion Thesaurus.synonym

The ``load`` command register a new synonym ``"popular"``. It is
substituted with ``((popular) OR (n_likes:>=10))``. The substituted
query means that "popular" is containing the word "popular" or 10 or
more liked entries.

The ``select`` command outputs records that ``n_likes`` column value
is equal to or more than ``10`` from ``Entries`` table.

Output related parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``output_columns``
""""""""""""""""""

It specifies output columns separated by ``,``.

Here is a simple ``output_columns`` usage example.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/commands/select/output_columns_simple.log
.. select Entries --output_columns '_id, _key' --limit 1

The ``select`` command just outputs ``_id`` and ``_key`` column
values.

``*`` is a special value. It means that all columns that are not
:doc:``/pseudo_column``.

Here is a ``*`` usage example.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/commands/select/output_columns_asterisk.log
.. select Entries --output_columns '_key, *' --limit 1

The ``select`` command outputs ``_key`` pseudo column, ``content``
column and ``n_likes`` column values but doesn't output ``_id`` pseudo
column value.

The default value is ``_id, _key, *``. It means that all column
values except ``_score`` are outputted.

``sortby``
""""""""""

It specifies sort keys separated by ``,``. Each sort key is column
name.

Here is a simple ``sortby`` usage example.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/commands/select/sortby_simple.log
.. select Entries --sortby 'n_likes, _id'

The ``select`` command sorts by ``n_likes`` column value in ascending
order. For records that has the same ``n_likes`` are sorted by ``_id``
in ascending order. ``"Good-bye Senna"`` and ``"Good-bye Tritonn"``
are the case.

If you want to sort in descending order, add ``-`` before column name.

Here is a descending order ``sortby`` usage example.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/commands/select/sortby_descending.log
.. select Entries --sortby '-n_likes, _id'

The ``select`` command sorts by ``n_likes`` column value in descending
order. But ascending order is used for sorting by ``_id``.

You can use ``_score`` pseudo column in ``sortby`` if you use
``query`` or ``filter`` parameter.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/commands/select/sortby_score_with_query.log
.. select Entries --match_columns content --query fast --sortby -_score --output_columns '_key, _score'

The ``select`` command sorts matched records by hit score in
descending order and outputs entry key and hit score.

If you use ``_score`` without ``query`` nor ``filter`` parameters,
it's just ignored but get a warning in log file.

``offset``
""""""""""

It specifies offset to choose output records range. Offset is
zero-origin. ``--offset 1`` means output range is started from the 2nd
record.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/commands/select/offset_simple.log
.. select Entries --sortby _id --offset 3 --output_columns _key

The ``select`` command outputs from the 4th record.

You can specify negative value. It means that ``the number of matched
records + offset``. If you have 3 matched records and specify
``--offset -2``, you get records from the 1st (``3 + -2 = 1``) record
to the 3rd record.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/commands/select/offset_negative.log
.. select Entries --sortby _id --offset -2 --output_columns _key

The ``select`` command outputs from the 4th record because the total
number of records is ``5``.

The default value is ``0``.

``limit``
"""""""""

It specifies the max number of output records. If the number of
matched records is less than ``limit``, all records are outputted.

Here is a simple ``limit`` usage example.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/commands/select/limit_simple.log
.. select Entries --sortby _id --offset 2 --limit 3 --output_columns _key

The ``select`` command outputs the 3rd, the 4th and the 5th records.

You can specify negative value. It means that ``the number of matched
records + limit + 1``. For example, ``--limit -1`` outputs all
records. It's very useful value to show all records.

Here is a simple negative ``limit`` value usage example.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/commands/select/limit_negative.log
.. select Entries --limit -1

The ``select`` command outputs all records.

The default value is ``10``.
