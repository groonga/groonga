.. Groonga Project

Windows
=======

This section describes how to install Groonga on Windows. You can
install Groonga by extracting a zip package.

We distribute both 32-bit and 64-bit packages but we strongly
recommend a 64-bit package for server. You should use a 32-bit package
just only for tests or development. You will encounter an out of
memory error with a 32-bit package even if you just process medium
size data.
