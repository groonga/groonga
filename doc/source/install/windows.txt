=======

This section describes how to install groonga on Windows. You can
install groogna by extracting a zip package or running an installer.

We distribute both 32-bit and 64-bit packages but we strongly
recommend a 64-bit package for server. You should use a 32-bit package
just only for tests or development. You will encounter an out of
memory error with a 32-bit package even if you just process medium
size data.

Installer
---------

For 32-bit environment: download `groonga-2.0.2-x86.exe
<http://packages.groonga.org/windows/groonga/groonga-2.0.2-x86.exe>`_
and run it.

For 64-bit environment, download `groonga-2.0.2-x64.exe
<http://packages.groonga.org/windows/groonga/groonga-2.0.2-x64.exe>`_
and run it.

Use command prompt for ``groonga`` command installed in start menu.

zip

``groonga`` command is in ``bin`` folder.

Build from source
-----------------

First, you need to install required tools for building groonga on
Windows. Here are required tools:

  * `Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Express
    <http://www.microsoft.com/japan/msdn/vstudio/express/>`_
  * `CMake <http://www.cmake.org/>`_

Download zipped source `groonga-2.0.2.zip
<http://packages.groonga.org/source/groonga/groonga-2.0.2.tar.gz>`_
and extract it.

Start ``Visual Studio Command Prompt (2010)`` installed by Microsoft
Visual Studio 2010 Express and move to the groonga's source folder::

  > cd c:\Users\%USERNAME%\Downloads\groonga-2.0.2

Configure by ``cmake``. The following commnad line is for 64-bit
version. If you want to build 32-bit version, use ``-G "Visual Studio
10"`` parameter instead::

  groonga-2.0.2> cmake . -G "Visual Studio 10 Win64" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:\groonga

Build by Visual Studio::

  groonga-2.0.2> devenv groonga.sln /Build Release

Install::

  groonga-2.0.2> devenv groonga.sln /Build Release /Project Install

After the above steps, :doc:`/executables/groonga` is found in
``c:\groonga\bin\groonga.exe``.
