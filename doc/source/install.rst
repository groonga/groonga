Install
=======

This section describes how to install Groonga on each
environment. There are packages for major platforms. It's recommended
that you use package instead of building Groonga by yourself. But
don't warry. There is a document about building Groonga from source.

We distribute both 32-bit and 64-bit packages but we strongly
recommend a 64-bit package for server. You should use a 32-bit package
just only for tests or development. You will encounter an out of
memory error with a 32-bit package even if you just process medium
size data.
