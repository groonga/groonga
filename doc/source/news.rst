Release 6.0.4 - 2016-06-06
--------------------------

It's a bug fix release of 6.0.3. It's recommend that Groonga 6.0.3
users upgrade to 6.0.4. This release fixes some search related
problems.

Fixes
^^^^^

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/select`] Fixed a bug that ``--drilldown``
  against a temporary column created by ``--columns`` refers freed
  memory.

Release 6.0.3 - 2016-05-29
--------------------------

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* [experimental] Added ``GRN_II_OVERLAP_TOKEN_SKIP_ENABLE`` and
  ``GRN_NGRAM_TOKENIZER_REMOVE_BLANK_DISABLE`` environment variables
  to improve performance of N-gram tokenizer.  [GitHub#533][Patch by
  Naoya Murakami]

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/table_create`] Stopped to ignore
  nonexistent default tokenizer, normalizer or token filters. In the
  previous versions, Groonga ignored a typo in
  ``--default_tokenizer``, ``--normalizer`` or ``--token_filters``
  parameter silently. It caused a delay in finding problems.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/select`] output_columns v1: Supported
  expression such as ``snippet_html(...)`` in output_columns.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/select`] Removed a limitation about the
  number of labeled drilldowns. In the previous versions, the number
  of max labeled drilldowns is limited to 10.

* [:doc:`/reference/functions/number_classify`] Added a number
  plugin. Use ``number_classify`` function to classify by value.

* Added a time plugin. Use ``time_classify_second``,
  ``time_classify_minute``, ``time_classify_hour``,
  ``time_classify_day``, ``time_classify_week``,
  ``time_classify_month``, ``time_classify_year`` function to classify
  by value.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/select`] Supported dynamic column
  creation which is used in ``output_columns``, ``drilldown`` or
  ``sortby`` [GitHub#539,#541,#542,#544,#545][Patch by Naoya Murakami]::

    select \
      --columns[LABEL].stage filtered \
      --columns[LABEL].type ShortText \
      --columns[LABEL].flags COLUMN_SCALAR \
      --columns[LABEL].value 'script syntax expression' \
      ...

* [experimental][:doc:`/reference/commands/select`] Improved
  performance for range/equal search and enough filtered case. Set
  ``GRN_TABLE_SELECT_ENOUGH_FILTERED_RATIO`` environment variable to
  enable this feature.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/select`] Supported index used search for
  filtered tables.

* Supported to detect changed database isn't closed. This feature is
  useful to check database corruption when Groonga is crashed
  unexpectedly.

* [:doc:`/reference/executables/grndb`] Supported detecting database
  wasn't closed successfully case.

* Added ``--drilldown_filter``.

* Supported ``filter`` in labeled drilldown.

* Improved performance for using [:doc:`/reference/functions/between`]
  without index. By between() optimization, there is a case that range
  search is 100x faster than the previous version of between().

* [:doc:`/reference/functions/record_number`] Supported window function.

* [experimental][:doc:`/reference/commands/select`] Supported ``--slices``.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/select`] Deprecated ``--sortby`` and
  ``--drilldown_sortby``. Use ``--sort_keys`` and
  ``-drilldown_sort_keys`` instead.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/select`] Deprecated ``--drilldown[...]``.
  Use ``--drilldowns[...]`` instead.

* Added [:doc:`/reference/command/command_version`] 3. It uses object
  literal based envelope.

* [groonga-httpd] Updated bundled nginx version to 1.11.0.

Fixes
^^^^^

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/select`] output_columns v2: Fixed a bug
  that ``*`` isn't expand to columns correctly.

* Fixed a bug that 1usec information is lost for time value.

* Fixed a crash bug when a mruby plugin is initialized with multiple
  threads.

* Fixed a bug that a process can't use more than one caches in parallel.
  [GitHub#515]

* Fixed a bug that internally used ``alloc_info`` structure which is used to find memory leaks is
  not exclusively accessed. Without this fix, it may causes a crash. [GitHub#523]

* [tokenizer mecab] Fixed a memory leak on dictionary encoding mismatch error.
  [groonga-dev,04012] [Reported by Naoya Murakami]

.. _release-5-0-8:

Release 5.0.8 - 2015-09-29
--------------------------

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* [Windows] Supported build with MySQL again.

* [:doc:`/reference/grn_expr/script_syntax`] Changed return value type
  to ``Bool`` from ``Int32`` for predicate operations such as
  :ref:`script-syntax-match-operator` and
  :ref:`script-syntax-equal-operator`.

* [:doc:`/reference/api`] Supported owning other ``grn_obj`` by
  ``GRN_PTR`` and ``GRN_PVECTOR`` bulk. If you specify ``GRN_OBJ_OWN``
  flag to ``GRN_PTR`` and ``GRN_PVECTOR`` bulks, they call
  :c:func:`grn_obj_close()` against ``grn_obj`` that is held by
  them when they are closed.

* [incompatible][:doc:`/reference/regular_expression`] Changed to
  normalize regular expression match target text before matching. It's
  for consistency and performance.

  Other operations such as :ref:`script-syntax-prefix-search-operator`
  normalize target text.

  Some simple regular expressions such as ``\Ahello`` can be
  evaluated by index. It's fast.

  If target text isn't normalized, you need to use complex regular
  expressions such as ``\A[Hh]ello`` and ``\A(?i)hello``. Complex
  regular expressions can't be evaluated by index. If target text is
  normalized, you can use simple regular expressions. They may be
  evaluated by index. It's fast.

* [doc] Improved documents.

  [GitHub#405][GitHub#409]
  [Reported by Hiroyuki Sato][Patch by Hiroyuki Sato]

* [:doc:`/reference/functions/highlight_html`] Improved performance.
  [groonga-dev,03427] [Reported by Hiroyuki Sato]

* [:doc:`/reference/functions/snippet_html`] Improved performance.

* [CMake] Stopped to run ``pkg-config`` twice.
  [Patch by Sergei Golubchik]

* Removed needless check for year in time. B.C. is always invalid time
  without this change. B.C. is valid time when system (``mktime()``)
  supports it with this change.

* [:c:func:`grn_ctx_is_opened()`] Added a new API that checks whether
  object with the ID is opened or not.

* [:c:func:`grn_obj_remove()`] Reduced the maximum memory usage. If
  :c:func:`grn_thread_get_limit()` returns ``1``, it closes temporary
  opened objects after it finished to use them.

* [doc][:doc:`/reference/commands/table_remove`] Updated with many
  descriptions.

* [:doc:`/reference/executables/groonga`] Ensured to add the last new
  line to :doc:`/reference/commands/dump` result on stand alone mode.

* [:ref:`process-log`] Added Groonga version into ``grn_init`` log.

* Opened `chat room on Gitter <https://gitter.im/groonga/public>`_.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/status`] Added ``start_time`` as alias of
  ``starttime`` for consistency. Other keys use ``snake_case`` style.
  ``starttime`` is deprecated. Use ``start_time`` instead.

* Updated bundled Onigmo.

* [doc][:doc:`/reference/scorers/scorer_tf_at_most`] Documented.

* Supported columns for temporary table. It's only available C API
  users for now. :doc:`/reference/commands/select` will use this
  feature in the next release.

* [``grn_vector_pop_element()``] Exported.

* [:doc:`/reference/executables/groonga`] Added checks whether
  acquiring lock is succeeded or not.

* [:doc:`/reference/executables/groonga-suggest-create-dataset`]
  Changed to use ``--normalizer`` instead of ``KEY_NORMALIZE`` because
  ``KEY_NORMALIZE`` is deprecated.

* [``grn_obj_cast()``] Exported.

* [experimental][``grn_ii_cursor``] Exported.

* [experimental][``grn_ii_cursor_open()``] Exported.

* [experimental][``grn_ii_cursor_next()``] Exported.

* [experimental][``grn_ii_cursor_close()``] Exported.

* [:ref:`script-syntax-match-operator`] Improved index detection.
  Index its lexicon has a tokenizer is preferred.

* [:doc:`/reference/executables/groonga-httpd`] Updated bundled nginx
  to 1.9.5 that supports HTTP/2. HTTP/2 module is enabled.

Fixes
^^^^^

* [:doc:`/reference/grn_expr/script_syntax`] Fixed a bug that ``&!``
  does nothing when right hand side is ``true``.

* Fixed performance regression with libtool 2.4.6.
  [GitHub#406][GitHub#407] [Patch by Hiroyuki Sato]

.. _release-5-0-7:

Release 5.0.7 - 2015-08-31
--------------------------

This release includes a bug fix of :ref:`offline-index-construction`.

If you're using any multiple column index (index column with
``WITH_SECTION`` flag) and :ref:`offline-index-construction`, we
recommend that you upgrade your Groonga.

This release has an important experimental feature for Windows users.
See "sparse file support" entry in the following improvement list for
details.

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* [experimental][Windows] Added sparse file support. It's experimental
  feature. It's disabled by default. You can enable it by specifying
  ``GRN_IO_USE_SPARSE=yes`` environment variable.

  It reduces database file size on Windows. Please try the feature and
  report the result. Groonga developers are interested in the
  followings:

  * Disk usage
  * Performance (Improved? Degraded? No difference?)
  * Memory usage (Especially virtual memory usage)

* [experimental][:doc:`/reference/commands/logical_shard_list`] Added
  a command that returns a shard list of the specified logical table.

* [experimental][:ref:`script-syntax-regular-expression-operator`]
  Supported regular expression match against vector column without
  index.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/logical_range_filter`] Supported
  ``--cache no`` option. It's same as :ref:`select-cache` option in
  :doc:`/reference/commands/select`.

* [:doc:`/reference/executables/groonga-httpd`] Supported returning
  the max number of threads feature of
  :doc:`/reference/commands/thread_limit`. You can't set the max
  number of threads.

* [:c:func:`grn_db_unmap()`] Added a new API that unmaps all opened
  tables and columns. It's a thread unsafe operation. You can't touch
  the database while :c:func:`grn_db_unmap()` is running.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/database_unmap`] Added a command that
  unmaps all opened tables and columns in database.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/object_exist`] Added a command that
  checks whether object with the specified name exists or not in
  database.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/column_copy`] Added a command that copies
  all values from source column to destination column.

  You can use this command to change column value type, column type,
  table type and so on.

* Stopped to use non-standard ``__uint32_t``
  type. [GitHub#375][Reported by Natanael Copa]

* [experimental][Windows] Supported Windows Event log.

* [mruby] Supported error handling on mruby initialization error.

* [experimental][:doc:`/reference/commands/thread_limit`] Renamed from
  ``thread_count``.

* Supported logging used indexes in ``info`` level and ``debug``
  level. It can be used like ``EXPLAIN`` in RDBMS. It's useful to
  improve slow query.

* [doc] Replaced deprecated ``KEY_NORMALIZE`` flags.
  [GitHub#378][GitHub#380][GitHub#382] [Patch by Hiroyuki Sato]

* [doc] Removed needless Sphinx configurations.
  [GitHub#379] [Patch by Ayumu Osanai]

* [experimental][incompatible][:ref:`script-syntax-regular-expression-operator`]
  Changed ``.`` match behavior. ``.`` matches new line. It's backward
  incompatible change.

* [doc][:doc:`/contribution/development/build`] Added a document about
  building Groonga as Groonga developer.
  [GitHub#353] [Suggested by Hiro Yoshioka]

Fixes
^^^^^

* [mruby] Fixed a time overflow bug.

* [:doc:`/reference/executables/groonga`] Fixed a crash bug when
  PID file can't be created. [GitHub#368] [Reported by Hiroyuki Sato]

* Fixed a bug that :ref:`offline-index-construction` may generate
  broken index. It may be caused for multiple column index. In other
  words, index column with ``WITH_SECTION`` flag may be broken.

  If you're using :ref:`online-index-construction` for index columns
  with ``WITH_SECTION`` flag, this bug isn't affected.

  You can recover this bug by recreating existing multiple column
  indexes.

* [:doc:`/reference/functions/query`] Fixed a crash bug when
  :doc:`/reference/functions/query` is used in :ref:`select-scorer`.

* [:ref:`select-filter`] Fixed a bug that
  :ref:`script-syntax-bitwise-not` against unsigned int value doesn't
  work for comparing to ``-NUMBER_LITERAL``.

  For example, the following expression doesn't work::

    ~UINT32_COLUMN == -6

* Fixed a bug that :ref:`script-syntax-regular-expression-operator`
  doesn't work in multithread.

* Fixed some memory leaks.

* Fixed a build error. [GitHub#381] [Patch by Hiroshi Hatake]

    table_create Numbers TABLE_PAT_KEY Int32
    column_create Numbers entries_numbers COLUMN_INDEX Entries numbers

    select Numbers --output_columns _key

* Supported ``'vector_text_column @ "element"'`` without index. For example, the
  ``select`` command in the following commands::

    table_create Memos TABLE_NO_KEY
    column_create Memos tags COLUMN_VECTOR Text

    load --table Memos
    [
    {"tags": ["Groonga", "Rroonga", "Mroonga"]}
    ]

    select Memos --filter 'tags @ "Rroonga"'

  option ``--use-windows-event-log``. It reports logs as Windows events.
  It's a experimental feature.
* [:doc:`/install/windows`] Used Groonga's default encoding for log message.
* Log used indexes in ``INFO`` level. The default level ``NOTICE``. So the logs aren't
  showed by default.

.. _release-5-0-5:

Release 5.0.5 - 2015-06-29
--------------------------

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Show correct error information such as NoSuchFileOrDirectory when opening a database.
* Don't set the default logger path for library use.

  * It's backward incompatible change. But it will not effect to many users.
  * Server use (groonga command, Mroonga, PGroonga and so on) users can get
    log by default. In server use, developers set up log in their software.
  * Most library use (Rroonga, groonga-gobject and so on) users couldn't get
    log by default with earlier versions. The default log path is system
    path such as /var/log/groonga/groonga.log. It's not writable for normal
    users.

* [windows] Show error information when memory isn't enough on failing ``CreateFileMapping()``.
* [:doc:`/reference/commands/tokenize`] Updated example to show new "force_prefix" value.
  This value is added since 5.0.4.
* [windows] Show error information when disk has any problem (disk full and so on) on failing ``FlushViewOfFile()``.
* [API] Added :c:func:`grn_obj_flush()`.
* [API] Added :c:func:`grn_obj_flush_recursive()`.
* [:doc:`/reference/commands/io_flush`] Added. It flushes memory mapped data to disk.
  Usually memory data automatically flush by an OS, but you can explicitly flush with
  this command.
* [mruby] Binded ``grn_obj_remove()`` to Object#remove.
* [mruby] Binded ``grn_table_delete()`` and ``grn_table_delete_by_id()`` to Table#delete.
* [:doc:`/reference/commands/logical_table_remove`] Added.
* [:doc:`/reference/commands/logical_select`] Added. ``--filter`` is only supported for now.
* [cmake] Supported embedded MeCab tokenizer.
* [:doc:`/reference/commands/logical_count`] Supported month and day mixed shards.
  In the same month, month shard must have earlier records rather than day
  shards in the same month. For example::

    XXX_201506   <- includes only 2015-06-01 and 2015-06-02 records
    XXX_20150603 <- includes only 2015-06-03 records
    XXX_20150604 <- includes only 2015-06-04 records

Fixes
^^^^^

* Fixed wrong macro to include netinet/in.h.
  [GitHub#348] [Reported by OBATA Akio]
* [rpm][:doc:`/reference/executables/groonga-httpd`] Fixed failing restart.

--------------------------

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* [mruby] Changed to use ``inspect`` to show meaningful error message for error value.
* [mruby] Supported ``Groonga::Bulk#inspect`` to inspect bulk content.
* [mruby] Supported ``Bulk#value`` to extract the value of record from bulk content.
* [mruby] Supported estimating size for ``reference_column == record_id`` in
  :doc:`/reference/commands/logical_range_filter`. In above case, it can be searched
  more effectively.
* [:doc:`/reference/functions/sub_filter`] Supported index column as ``scope`` parameter.
* [:doc:`/reference/grn_expr/script_syntax`] Described clearly about numerical
  value. [GitHub groonga/groonga.org#16] [Suggested by Hiroyuki Sato]
* [:doc:`/reference/commands/select`] Supported accessing other table's record in filter.
  You can use ``--filter 'OTHER_TABLE[KEY].COLUMN'`` for example.
* [:doc:`/reference/commands/select`] Supported operator in table key.
  You can use ``--filter 'OTHER_TABLE["SOME STRING" + "ANOTHER STRING"].COLUMN'"`` for example.
* [example] Used Ruby 2.0 or later API in script for converting dictionary data.
* Changed to show error message about invalid type of keys about table.
* [doc] Fixed link from sourceforge.jp to osdn.me or osdn.jp about mailing list preference page.
  SourceForge.jp is marked as obsoleted because of branding issue since May 11, 2015.
* [:doc:`/reference/commands/tokenize`] Added ``force_prefix`` value to each token information. [Patch by Naoya Murakami]
* Supported to search by shorter words such as 2 or less characters for :ref:`token-trigram`.
  [Patch by Naoya Murakami]
* [deb] Added service file for Systemd into groonga-httpd and groonga-server-gqtp packages.
* [:doc:`/reference/commands/select`] Ignored ``--query`` when its
  value consists of only space characters. Space characters include
  full-width space (``U+3000 IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE`` in
  Unicode). [Suggested by TomyGX]

Fixes
^^^^^

* Fixed a crash bug when empty key is specified for ``drilldown[label].keys``.
* Fixed a bug that the return value of ``grn_parse_query_flags`` is not properly checked.
  [GitHub#336] [Reported by Hiroaki Nakamura]
* Fixed a build error on some BSD systems. They doesn't have ``-i`` option for ``sed``.
* Fixed a build error on Solaris. It is changed to initialize by ``sizeof(msghdr)`` in ``memset()`` because
  ``msg_control``, ``msg_controllen`` and ``msg_flags`` doesn't exist on Solaris by default.
* [:doc:`/reference/tokenizers`] Fixed a typo. [GitHub#338] [Reported by Hiroyuki Sato]
* [:doc:`/reference/output`] Fixed markup. [GitHub groonga/groonga.org#17]
  [Reported by Hiroyuki Sato]
* Reduced getenv() in each ``grn_ii_cursor_set_min()``. This fixes performance
  regression on Windows.
* Fixed a build error on OpenBSD. [groonga-dev,03255] [Reported by fbnteqr]
* [:doc:`/reference/executables/groonga-httpd`] Fixed a bug that same message is
  logged.
* Fixed a crash bug which is caused by double free memory.
* Fixed a memory leak. It's occurred when ``--match_columns`` and ``--query`` are
  used for non indexed text field and text fields have a value that isn't bulk
  embeddable. Normally, 32byte over size text isn't bulk embeddable, so this bug
  doesn't affect to the case if only small text less than 32byte are stored.
* [:doc:`/reference/tokenizers`] [TokenRegexp] Fixed a bug that it can't be searched
  correctly when query contains characters which are treated as blank character.
  For example, the newline - "\\n" is typical one.

  Skip the last one character token.
* [mruby] Supported regexp pattern for estimating size.
* [mruby] Supported size estimation for accessor.
* [:doc:`/reference/commands/logical_range_filter`] Removed ``GRN_LOGICAL_RANGE_FILTER_ENABLED``

  Use ``GRN_LOGICAL_RANGE_FILTER_THRESHOLD=0`` to disable range index search
  feature.
* [:doc:`/reference/commands/logical_range_filter`] Supported negative limit and offset.
* [:doc:`/install/windows`] Used `Groonga Admin <https://github.com/groonga/groonga-admin>`_ in package.
* [:doc:`/reference/commands/logical_range_filter`] Changed threshold meaning:

.. _release-5-0-1:

Release 5.0.1 - 2015-03-29
--------------------------

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/logical_range_filter`] Supported filter
  and sort.
* Supported range search by multiple column index.
* Added API :doc:`/reference/api/overview` document for users who want
  to use Groonga as library.
* [incompatible] Changed internal type of ``_score`` to floating point
  number from 32bit integer number. This is incompatible change for DB
  API users. This *isn't* incompatible change for query API users. It
  means that users who just use :doc:`/reference/commands/select`
  aren't affected. Use the following code that works with both older
  and newer Groonga:

  .. code-block:: c

     grn_obj *score;
     double score_value;

     if (score->header.domain == GRN_DB_FLOAT) {
       score_value = GRN_FLOAT_VALUE(score);
     } else {
       score_value = (double)GRN_INT32_VALUE_FLOAT_VALUE(score);
     }

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/select`] Added more strict check for
  invalid drilldown parameter.
* Added :c:func:`grn_ctx_get_all_tables()`. [Suggested by Masatoshi
  Teruya]
* Supported to customize score function. See :doc:`/reference/scorer`
  for details.
* [incompatible] Custom score function feature introduced API and ABI
  incompatibilities in DB API layer. If you're using
  :c:type:`grn_search_optarg`, please check that your code initializes
  your :c:type:`grn_search_optarg` by ``0`` like the following:

  .. code-block:: c

     grn_search_optarg options;
     memset(&options, 0, sizeof(grn_search_optarg));

  If your code do the above thing, your code is API compatible and ABI
  incompatible. You just need to rebuild your code without
  modification.

  If your code doesn't the above thing, you need to added the above
  thing to your code.

* Added the following predicates that check :c:type:`grn_obj` type to
  DB API:

  * :c:func:`grn_obj_is_table()`
  * :c:func:`grn_obj_is_proc_proc()`
  * :c:func:`grn_obj_is_function_proc()`
  * :c:func:`grn_obj_is_selector_proc()`
  * :c:func:`grn_obj_is_scorer_proc()`

* [experimental] Supported skipping posting list when searching
  popular term and rare term at the same time. It will improve
  performance. Set ``GRN_II_CURSOR_SET_MIN_ENABLE`` environment
  variable to ``1`` to enable the feature. The feature is disabled by
  default.
* [doc] Added :doc:`/reference/functions/in_values` document.
* [doc] Added :doc:`/reference/commands/logical_count` document.
* [mruby] Implemented custom ``#inspect`` method. Is is useful for
  debugging.
* Added :doc:`/reference/scorers/scorer_tf_at_most` scorer. It
  limits not to exceed specified score regardless of term frequency.
* [mruby] Supported estimating matched records for selecting index
  search or sequential search.
* Added the following functions to estimate size by index:

  * :c:func:`grn_expr_estimate_size()`
  * :c:func:`grn_ii_estimate_size_for_query()`
  * :c:func:`grn_ii_estimate_size_for_lexicon_cursor()`

* Added missing :ref:`normalizer-auto` availability check. [GitHub#283]
  [Reported by Tasuku SUENAGA]
* Dropped Visual Studio 2010 support.
* [experimental][mecab] Supported chunked tokenization. This feature
  is a workaround for MeCab's "too long sentense" error.  Specify
  ``yes`` to ``GRN_MECAB_CHUNKED_TOKENIZE_ENABLED`` environment
  variable to enable it. By this configuration, Groonga splits a long
  text (8192 bytes over text by default) into small chunks and passes
  each chunk to MeCab. By this process, the above error isn't
  occurred. Additionally, you can customize chunk threshold bytes by
  ``GRN_MECAB_CHUNK_SIZE_THRESHOLD`` environment variable. Note that
  ``,``, ``.``, ``!``, ``?``, ``U+3001 IDEOGRAPHIC COMMA``, ``U+3002
  IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP``, ``U+FF01 FULLWIDTH EXCLAMATION MARK`` and
  ``U+FF1F FULLWIDTH QUESTION MARK`` are treated as chunk delimiter
  characters.
* Supported ``--pid-file`` in server mode of
  :doc:`/reference/executables/groonga`.
* [groonga-httpd] Supported graceful stop to clean Groonga. It doesn't
  terminate the open connections immediately.
* [experimental] Supported regular expression. See
  :doc:`/reference/regular_expression` to know about how to use regular
  expression.
* [experimental] Added :doc:`/reference/commands/plugin_unregister`
  command.
* [http][:doc:`/reference/commands/load`] Added "," as chunk separator
  in POST data. It decreases internal buffer size and improves load
  time when POST data don't include any new line.
* [doc] Added :doc:`/reference/tokenizers` document.
* Improved POSIX.2 compatibility by using ``.`` as bash's "source"
  command replacement. [GitHub#317] [Patch by Jun Kuriyama]
* [windows] Changed to the default IO version 1. It reduces disk usage
  on Windows. [groonga-dev,03118] [Tested by ongaeshi]
* [httpd] Updated bundled nginx version to the latest mainline
  (1.7.11).
* Changed mime-type for TSV output to ``text/tab-separated-values``
  from ``text/plain``.
* [:ref:`token-filter-stop-word`] Supported
  :ref:`offline-index-construction`. [GitHub#296] [Patch by Naoya
  Murakami]

Fixes
^^^^^

* Fixed not to use obsolete ``--address`` parameter in the default
  groonga.conf. ``--bind-address`` is used instead.  [Groonga-talk]
  [Reported by Dewangga]
* [:doc:`/reference/commands/truncate`] Fixed a bug that
  :ref:`table-no-key` table can't be truncated.
* [mecab] Reduced needless logs for "empty token" and "ignore empty
  token".
* Fixed a bug that wrong section in index is used. It means that wrong
  search result is returned. If you satisfy all of the following
  conditions, this bug is occurred:

  * Multiple indexes are available.
  * The first defined index or the last defined index are
    multi-column indexes.
  * When both of the first defined index and the last defined index are
    multi-column indexes, source column orders are different in them.

* Fixed a bug that passing Groonga command line to
  :doc:`/reference/executables/groonga` from shell command line style
  usage always returns ``0`` as exit code. For example, ``groonga
  DB_PATH nonexistent_command`` always returned ``0`` as exist code.
* Fixed a bug that plugin path may be broken when two or more plugins
  registered. [Reported by Naoya Murakami]
* Fixed a bug that ``Lexicon.index.source_column_name`` style in
  :ref:`select-match-columns` doesn't work when source
  column specified by ``source_column_name`` has two or more
  indexes. [Reported by Naoya Murakami]

  on FreeBSD 10.1. `[MDEV-7293] <https://mariadb.atlassian.net/browse/MDEV-7293>`_
  [Reported by Bernard Spil]
* Supported to customize plugins directory. Set `GRN_PLUGINS_DIR` environment variable.
