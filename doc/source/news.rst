Release 11.0.6 - 2021-08-29
---------------------------

Improvements
------------

* Added support for recovering on crash. (experimental)

  This is a experimental feature. Currently, this feature is still not stable.

  If Groonga crashes, it recovers the database automatically when it opens a database for the first time since the crash. However, This feature can't recover the database automatically in all crash cases.
  We need to recover the database manually depending on timing even if this feature enables.

  Groonga execute WAL (write ahead log) when this feature is enable.
  We can dump WAL by the following tools, but currently, users doesn't need to use them.

    * [:doc:`reference/executables/grndb`] ``dump-wal`` command.
    * ``dump-wal.rb`` scritp.

* [:doc:`/install/debian`] Added how to install Groonga into Debian 11 (bullseye).

* [:doc:`reference/commands/cache_limit`] Groonga remove cache when we execute ``cache_limit 0``. [GitHub#1224][Reported by higchi]

  Groonga stores query cache to internally table.
  The maximum total size of keys of this table is 4GiB. Because this table is hash table.
  Therefore, If we execute many huge queries, Groonga may be unable to store query cache, because the maximum total size of keys may be over 4GiB.
  In such cases, We can clear the table for query cache by using ``cache_limit 0``, and Groonga can store query cache 

Fixes
-----

* Fixed a bug that Groonga doesn't clear lock when some threads open the same object around the same time.

  If some threads open the same object around the same time, threads except for a thread that executes the opening object at first are waiting for opening the target object.
  At this time, threads that wait for an opening object take locks, but these locks are not released.
  Therefore, these locks remain until Groonga's process is restarted in the above case, and a new thread can't also open the object all the time until Groonga's process is restarted.

  However, this bug rarely happens. Because a time of a thread open the object is a very short time. 

* [:doc:`reference/functions/query_parallel_or`] Fixed a bug that result may be different from the ``query()``.

  For example, If we used ``query("tags || tags2", "beginner man")``, the following record was a match, but if we used ``query_parallel_or("tags || tags2", "beginner man")``, the following record wasn't a match until now.

  * ``{"_key": "Bob",   "comment": "Hey!",       "tags": ["expert", "man"], "tags2": ["beginner"]}``

  Even if we use ``query_parallel_or("tags || tags2", "beginner man")``, the above record is match by this modification.

Known Issues
------------

* Currently, Groonga has a bug that there is possible that data is corrupt when we execute many additions, delete, and update data to vector column.

* [The browser based administration tool] Currently, Groonga has a bug that a search query that is inputted to non-administration mode is sent even if we input checks to the checkbox for the administration mode of a record list.

* ``*<`` and ``*>`` only valid when we use ``query()`` the right side of filter condition.
  If we specify as below, ``*<`` and ``*>`` work as ``&&``.

    * ``'content @ "Groonga" *< content @ "Mroonga"'``

* Groonga may not return records that should match caused by ``GRN_II_CURSOR_SET_MIN_ENABLE``.

Release 11.0.5 - 2021-07-29
---------------------------

Improvements
------------

* [:doc:`/reference/normalizers`] Added support for multiple normalizers.

  We can specify multiple normalizers by ``--notmalizers`` option when we create a table since this release.
  If we can also specify them by  ``--normalizer`` existing option because of compatibility.

  We added ``NormalizerTable`` for customizing a normalizer in Groonga 11.0.4.
  We can more flexibly behavior of the normalizer by combining ``NormalizerTable`` with existing normalizer.

  For example, this feature is useful in the following case.

    * Search for a telephone number. However, we import data handwritten by OCR.
      If data is handwritten, OCR may misunderstand a number and string(e.g. 5 and S).

  The details are as follows.

           ]
         ]
       ]
     ]

  Existing normalizers can't meet in such case, but we can meet it by combining ``NormalizerTable`` with existing normalizer since this release.

* [:doc:`reference/functions/query_parallel_or`][:doc:`reference/functions/query`] Added support for customizing thresholds for sequential search.

  We can customize thresholds in each queries whether to use sequential search by the following options.

    * ``{"max_n_enough_filtered_records": xx}``

      ``max_n_enough_filtered_records`` specify the number of records.
      ``query`` or ``query_parallel_or`` use sequential search when they seems to narrow down until under this number.

    * ``{"enough_filtered_ratio": x.x}``

      ``enough_filtered_ratio`` specify percentage of total.
      ``query`` or ``query_parallel_or`` use sequential search when they seems to narrow down until under this percentage.
      For example, if we specify ``{"enough_filtered_ratio": 0.5}``, ``query`` or ``query_parallel_or`` use sequential search when they seems to narrow down until half of the whole.

  The details are as follows.

       select \
         --table Products \
         --filter 'query("name", "r name:Ruby", {"max_n_enough_filtered_records": 10})'

* [:doc:`/reference/functions/between`][:doc:`/reference/functions/in_values`] Added support for customizing thresholds for sequential search.

  [:doc:`/reference/functions/between`] and [:doc:`/reference/functions/in_values`] have a feature that they switch to sequential search when the target of search records is narrowed down enough.

  The value of ``GRN_IN_VALUES_TOO_MANY_INDEX_MATCH_RATIO`` / ``GRN_BETWEEN_TOO_MANY_INDEX_MATCH_RATIO`` is used as threshold whether Groonga execute sequential search or search with indexes in such a case.

  This behavior is customized by only the following environment variable until now.

  ``in_values()``::

    # Don't use auto sequential search
    GRN_IN_VALUES_TOO_MANY_INDEX_MATCH_RATIO=-1
    # Set threshold to 0.02
    GRN_IN_VALUES_TOO_MANY_INDEX_MATCH_RATIO=0.02

  ``between()``::

    # Don't use auto sequential search
    GRN_BETWEEN_TOO_MANY_INDEX_MATCH_RATIO=-1
    # Set threshold to 0.02
    GRN_BETWEEN_TOO_MANY_INDEX_MATCH_RATIO=0.02

  if customize by the environment variable, this threshold applies to all queries, but we can specify it in each query by using this feature.

  The details are as follows. We can specify the threshold by using ``{"too_many_index_match_ratio": x.xx}`` option.
  The value type of this option is ``double``.

Fixes
-----

* [:doc:`reference/functions/query_parallel_or`][:doc:`reference/functions/query`] Fixed a bug that if we specify ``query_options`` and the other options, the other options are ignored.

  For example, ``"default_operator": "OR"`` option had been ignored in the following case.

Known Issues
------------

* Currently, Groonga has a bug that there is possible that data is corrupt when we execute many additions, delete, and update data to vector column.

* [The browser based administration tool] Currently, Groonga has a bug that a search query that is inputted to non-administration mode is sent even if we input checks to the checkbox for the administration mode of a record list.

* ``*<`` and ``*>`` only valid when we use ``query()`` the right side of filter condition.
  If we specify as below, ``*<`` and ``*>`` work as ``&&``.

    * ``'content @ "Groonga" *< content @ "Mroonga"'``

* If we repeat that we remove any data and load them again, Groonga may not return records that should match.

.. _release-11-0-4:

Release 11.0.4 - 2021-06-29
---------------------------

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* [Normalizer] Added support for customized normalizer.

  We define a table for normalize to use this feature.
  We can normalize with use that table.
  In other words, we can use customized normalizer.

  For example, we define that "S" normalize to "5" in the following example.
  The ``Substitutions`` table is for nromalize.

    .. code-block::

       table_create Substitutions TABLE_PAT_KEY ShortText
       column_create Substitutions substituted COLUMN_SCALAR ShortText
       load --table Substitutions
       [
       {"_key": "S", "substituted": "5"}
       ]

       table_create TelLists TABLE_NO_KEY
       column_create TelLists tel COLUMN_SCALAR ShortText

       table_create Terms TABLE_HASH_KEY ShortText \
         --default_tokenizer TokenNgram \
         --normalizer 'NormalizerTable("column", "Substitutions.substituted", \
                                       "report_source_offset", true)'
       column_create Terms tel_index COLUMN_INDEX|WITH_POSITION TelLists tel

       load --table TelLists
       [
       {"tel": "03-4S-1234"}
       ]

       select TelLists --filter 'tel @ "03-45-1234"'
       [
         [
           0,
           1624686303.538532,
           0.001319169998168945
         ],
         [
           [
             [
               1
             ],
             [
               [
                 "_id",
                 "UInt32"
               ],
               [
                 "tel",
                 "ShortText"
               ]
             ],
             [
               1,
               "03-4S-1234"
             ]
           ]
         ]
       ]

  For example, we can define to the table easy to false recognize words when we input a handwritten data.
  By this, we can normalize incorrect data to correct data.

  Note that we need to reconstruct the index if we updated the table for normalize.

* Added a new command ``object_warm``.

  This commnad ship Groonga's DB to OS's page cache.

  If we never startup Groonga after OS startup, Groonga's DB doesn't exist on OS's page cache
  When Groonga on the first run.
  Therefore, the first operation to Groonga is slow.

  If we execute this command in advance, the first operation to Groonga is fast.
  In Linux, we can do the same by also executing ``cat *.db > dev/null``.
  However, we could not do the same thing in Windows until now.

  By using this command, we can ship Groonga's DB to OS's page cache in both Linux and Windows.
  Then, we can also do that in units of table, column, and index.
  Therefore, we can ship only table, column, and index that we often use to OS's page cache.

  We can execute this command against various targets as below.

    * If we specify ``object_warm --name index_name``, the index is shipped to OS's page cache.
    * If we specify ``object_warm --name column_name``, the column is shipped to OS's page cache.
    * If we specify ``object_warm --name table_name`` is shipped to OS's page cache.
    * If we specify ``object_warm``, whole Groonga's database is shipped to OS's page cache.

  However, note that if OS has not empty space on memory, this command has no effect.

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Added support for adjusting the score of a specific record in ``--filter``.

  We can adjust the score of a specific record by using a oprtator named ``*~``.
  ``*~`` is logical operator same as ``&&`` and ``||``. Therefore, we can use ``*~`` like as ``&&`` ans ``||``.
  Default weight of ``*~`` is -1.

  Therefore, for example, ``'content @ "Groonga" *~ content @ "Mroonga"'`` mean the following operations.

    1. Extract records that match ``'content @ "Groonga"`` and ``content @ "Mroonga"'``.
    2. Add a score as below.

       a. Calculate the score of ``'content @ "Groonga"``.
       b. Calculate the score of ``'content @ "Mroonga"'``.
       c. b's score multiplied by -1 by ``*~``.
       d. The socre of this record is a + b
          Therefore, if a's socre is 1 and b's score is 1, the score of this record  is 1 + (1 * -1) = 0.

  Then, we can specify score quantity by ``*~${score_quantity}``.

  In particular, the following query adjust the score of match records by the following condition(``'content @ "Groonga" *~2.5 content @ "Mroonga")'`` ).

    .. code-block::

       table_create Memos TABLE_NO_KEY

       load --table Memos
       [
       {"content": "Groonga is a full text search engine."},
       {"content": "Rroonga is the Ruby bindings of Groonga."},
       {"content": "Mroonga is a MySQL storage engine based of Groonga."}
       ]

       select Memos \
         --command_version 3 \
         --filter 'content @ "Groonga" *~2.5 content @ "Mroonga"' \
         --output_columns 'content, _score' \
         --sort_keys -_score,_id
       {
         "header": {
           "return_code": 0,
           "start_time": 1624605205.641078,
           "elapsed_time": 0.002965450286865234
         },
         "body": {
           "n_hits": 3,
           "columns": [
             {
               "name": "content",
               "type": "ShortText"
             },
             {
               "name": "_score",
               "type": "Float"
             }
           ],
           "records": [
             [
               "Groonga is a full text search engine.",
               1.0
             ],
             [
               "Rroonga is the Ruby bindings of Groonga.",
               1.0
             ],
             [
               "Mroonga is a MySQL storage engine based of Groonga.",
               -1.5
             ]
           ]
         }
       }

  We can do the same by also useing :ref:`select-adjuster` .
  If we use :ref:`select-adjuster` , we need to make ``--filter`` condition and ``--adjuster`` conditon on our application, but we make only ``--filter`` condition on it by this improvement.

  We can also describe filter condition as below by using ``query()``.

    * ``--filter 'content @ "Groonga" *~2.5 content @ "Mroonga"'``

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Added support for ``&&`` with weight.

  We can use ``&&`` with weight by using ``*<`` or ``*>``.
  Default weight of ``*<`` is 0.5. Default weight of ``*>`` is 2.0.

  We can specify score quantity by ``*<${score_quantity}`` and ``*>${score_quantity}``.
  Then, if we specify ``*<${score_quantity}``, a plus or minus sign of ``${score_quantity}`` is reverse.

  For example, ``'content @ "Groonga" *<2.5 query("content", "MySQL")'`` is as below.

    1. Extract records that match ``'content @ "Groonga"`` and ``content @ "Mroonga"'``.
    2. Add a score as below.

       a. Calculate the score of ``'content @ "Groonga"``.
       b. Calculate the score of ``query("content", "MySQL")``.
       c. b's score multiplied by -2.5 by ``*<``.
       d. The socre of this record is a + b
          Therefore, if a's socre is 1 and b's score is 1, the score of this record is 1 + (1 * -2.5) = -1.5.

  In particular, the following query adjust the score of match records by the following condition( ``'content @ "Groonga" *<2.5 query("content", "Mroonga")'`` ).

             ]
           ]
         }
       }

* [:doc:`reference/log`] Added support for outputting to stdout and stderr.

  [:ref:`process-log`] and [:ref:`query-log`] supported　output to stdout and stderr.

    * If we specify as ``--log-path -``, ``--query-log-path -``, Groonga output log to stdout.
    * If we specify as ``--log-path +``, ``--query-log-path +``, Groonga output log to stderr.

  [:ref:`process-log`] is for all of Groonga works.
  [:ref:`query-log`] is just for query processing.

  This feature is useful when we execute Groonga on Docker.
  Docker has the feature that records stdout and stderr in standard.
  Therefore, we don't need to login into the environment of Docker to get Groonga's log.

  For example, this feature is useful as he following case.

    * If we want to analyze slow queries of Groonga on Docker.

      If we specify ``--query-log-path -`` when startup Groonga, we can analyze slow queries by only execution the following commands.

        * ``docker logs ${container_name} | groonga-query-log-analyze``

  By this, we can analyze slow query with the query log that output from Groonga on Docker simply.

* [Documentation] Filled missing documentation of ``string_substring``. [GitHub#1209][Patched by Takashi Hashida]

Known Issues
------------

* Currently, Groonga has a bug that there is possible that data is corrupt when we execute many additions, delete, and update data to vector column.

* [The browser based administration tool] Currently, Groonga has a bug that a search query that is inputted to non-administration mode is sent even if we input checks to the checkbox for the administration mode of a record list.

* ``*<`` and ``*>`` only valid when we use ``query()`` the right side of filter condition.
  If we specify as below, ``*<`` and ``*>`` work as ``&&``.

    * ``'content @ "Groonga" *< content @ "Mroonga"'``

.. _release-11-0-3:

Release 11.0.3 - 2021-05-29
===========================

Improvements
------------

* [:doc:`reference/functions/query`] Added support for ignoring ``TokenFilterStem`` by the query.

  * ``TokenFilterStem`` can search by using a stem.
    For example, all of ``develop``, ``developing``, ``developed`` and ``develops`` tokens are stemmed as ``develop``.
    So we can find ``develop``, ``developing`` and ``developed`` by ``develops`` query.

  * In this release, we are able to search without ``TokenFilterStem`` in only a specific query as below.

  * This feature is useful when users want to search by a stemmed word generally but users sometimes want to search by a exact (not stemmed) word as below.

    * If Groonga returns many results when searching by a stemmed word.
    * If ``TokenFilterStem`` returns the wrong result of stemming.
    * If we want to find only records that have an exact (not stemmed) word.

* [:doc:`reference/functions/query`] Added support for ignoring ``TokenFilterStopWord`` by the query.

  * ``TokenFilterStopWord`` searched without stop word that we registered beforehand.
    It uses for reducing noise of search by ignoring frequently word (e.g., ``and``, ``is``, and so on.).
  * However, we sometimes want to search include these words only a specific query. In this release, we are able to search without ``TokenFilterStopWord`` in only a specific query as below.

  * This feature is useful if that Groonga can't return results correctly if we don't search by keywords include commonly used words (e.g., if a search for a song title, a shop name, and so on.).

* [:doc:`/reference/normalizers`][NormalizerNFKC] Added a new option ``remove_new_line``.

  * If we want to normalize the key of a table that stores data, we set a normalizer to it.
    However, normally, normalizers remove a new line.
  * Groonga can't handle a key that is only a new line.
  * We can register data that is only a new line as key by this option.

* [:doc:`/reference/functions/string_slice`] Added a new function ``string_slice()``. [Github#1177][Patched by Takashi Hashida]

  * ``string_slice()`` extracts a substring of a string.
  * To enable this function, we need to register ``functions/string`` plugin.
  * We can use two different extraction methods depending on the arguments as below.

    * Extraction by position::

* [:doc:`/install/ubuntu`] Dropped support for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus).

* Added EditorConfig for Visual Studio. [GitHub#1191][Patched by Takashi Hashida]

  * Most settings are for Visual Studio only.

* [httpd] Updated bundled nginx to 1.20.1.

  * Contains security fix of CVE-2021-23017.

Fixes
-----

* Fixed a bug that Groonga may not have returned a result of a search query if we sent many search queries when tokenizer, normalizer, or token_filters that support options were used.

Known Issues
------------

* Currently, Groonga has a bug that there is possible that data is corrupt when we execute many additions, delete, and update data to vector column.

* [The browser based administration tool] Currently, Groonga has a bug that a search query that is inputted to non-administration mode is sent even if we input checks to the checkbox for the administration mode of a record list.

Thanks

.. _release-11-0-2:

Release 11.0.2 - 2021-05-10
===========================

Improvements
------------

* [Documentation] Removed a reference about ``ruby_load`` command. [GitHub#1172][Patched by Anthony M. Cook]

  * Because this command has already deleted.

* [:doc:`/install/debian`] Added support for Debian 11(Bullseye).

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Added support for ``--post_filter``.

  * We can use ``post_filter`` to filter by ``filtered`` stage dynamic columns as below.

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Added support for describing expression into ``--sort_keys``.

  * We can describe the expression into ``--sort_keys``.

    * If nonexistent keys into expression as a ``--sort_keys``, they are ignored and outputted warns into a log.

  * By this, for example, we can specify a value of an element of ``VECTOR COLUMN`` to ``--sort_keys``. And we can sort a result with it.
  * We can sort a result with an element of ``VECTOR COLUMN`` even if the before version by using dynamic column.
    However, we can sort a result with an element of ``VECTOR COLUMN`` without using dynamic column by this feature.

* [:doc:`/reference/token_filters`] Added support for multiple token filters with options.

  * We can specify multiple token filters with options like ``--token_filters 'TokenFilterStopWord("column", "ignore"), TokenFilterNFKC130("unify_kana", true)'``. [Github#mroonga/mroonga#399][Reported by MASUDA Kazuhiro]

* [:doc:`reference/functions/query`] Added support a dynamic column of ``result_set`` stage with complex expression.

  * Complex expression is that it needs temporary result sets internally like a following expression.

    .. code-block::

       '(true && query("name * 10", "ali", {"score_column": "ali_score"})) || \
        (true && query("name * 2", "li", {"score_column": "li_score"}))'

    * In the above expressions, the temporary result sets are used to store the result of evaluating the ``true``.
    * Therefore, for example, in the following expression, we can use a value of dynamic column of ``result_set`` stage in expression. Because temporary result sets internally are needless as below expression.

      .. code-block::

         '(query("name * 10", "ali", {"score_column": "ali_score"})) || \
          (query("name * 2", "li", {"score_column": "li_score"}))'

  * In this release, for example, we can set a value to ``li_score`` as below. (The value of ``li_score`` had been ``0`` in before version. Because the second expression could not get dynamic column.)

    * If we use a dynamic vector column, the storing values are appended values of each element.

* [:doc:`/install/ubuntu`] Added support for Ubuntu 21.04 (Hirsute Hippo).

* [httpd] Updated bundled nginx to 1.19.10.

Known Issues
------------

* Currently, Groonga has a bug that there is possible that data is corrupt when we execute many additions, delete, and update data to vector column.

* [The browser based administration tool] Currently, Groonga has a bug that a search query that is inputted to non-administration mode is sent even if we input checks to the checkbox for the administration mode of a record list. [Github#1186][Reported by poti]

.. _release-11-0-1:

Release 11.0.1 - 2021-03-31
===========================

Improvements
------------

* [:doc:`/install/debian`] Added support for a ARM64 package.

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Added support for customizing adjust weight every key word.

  * We need to specify ``<`` or ``>`` to all keywords to adjust scores until now.
    Because the default adjustment of weight (6 or 4) is larger than the default score (1).

    * Therefore, for example, "A"'s weight is 1 and "B"'s weight is 4 in ``A <B``.
      Decremented "B"'s weight (4) is larger than not decremented "A"'s weight (1).
      This is not works as expected.
      we need to specify ``>A <B`` to use smaller weight than "A" for "B".
      "A"'s weight is 6 and "B"'s weight is 4 in ``>A <B``.

  * We can customize adjustment of weight every key word by only specifying ``<${WEIGHT}`` or ``>${WEIGHT}`` to target keywords since this release.
    For example, "A"'s weight is 1 and "B"'s weight is 0.9 in ``A <0.1B`` ("B"'s weight decrement 0.1).

  * However, note that these forms ( ``>${WEIGHT}...``, ``<${WEIGHT}...``, and ``~${WEIGHT}...`` ) are incompatible.

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Added support for outputting ``Float`` and ``Float32`` value in Apache Arrow format.

  * For example, Groonga output as below.

  .. code-block::

     table_create Data TABLE_NO_KEY
     column_create Data float COLUMN_SCALAR Float

     load --table Data
     [
     {"float": 1.1}
     ]

     select Data \
       --command_version 3 \
       --output_type apache-arrow

       _id: uint32
       float: double
       -- metadata --
       GROONGA:n_hits: 1
       	_id	     float
       0	  1	  1.100000

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Added support for getting a reference destination data via index column when we output a result.

  * Until now, Groonga had returned involuntary value when we specified output value like ``index_column.xxx``.
    For example, A value of ``--columns[tags].value purchases.tag`` was ``["apple",["many"]],["banana",["man"]],["cacao",["man"]]`` in the following example. In this case, the expected values was ``["apple",["man","many"]],["banana",["man"]],["cacao",["woman"]]``.
    In this release, we can get a correct reference destination data via index column as below.

          ]
        ]
      ]

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Added support for specifying index column directly as a part of nested index.

  * We can search source table after filtering by using ``index_column.except_source_column``.
    For example, we specify ``comments.content`` when searching in the following example.
    In this case, at first, this query execute full text search from ``content`` column of ``Commentts`` table, then fetch the records of Articles table which refers to already searched records of Comments table.

      ]

  * It makes easier to add JSON data into reference columns by this feature.
  * Currently, this feature only support with JSON input.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/load`] Added support for loading reference vector from JSON text.

  * Currently, this feature doesn't support nested reference record.

* [Windows] Added support for UNIX epoch for ``time_classify_*`` functions.

  * Groonga handles timestamps on local time. Therefore, for example, if we input the UNIX epoch in Japan, inputting time is 9 hours behind the UNIX epoch.

  * The Windows API outputs an error when we input the time before the UNIX epoch.

  * We can use the UNIX epoch in ``time_classify_*`` functions as below in this release.

* [:doc:`reference/functions/query_parallel_or`] Added a new function for processing queries in parallel.

  * ``query_parallel_or`` requires Apache Arrow for processing queries in parallel.
    If it does not enable, ``query_parallel_or`` processes queries in sequence.

  * ``query_parallel_or`` processes combination of ``match_columns`` and ``query_string`` in parallel.

  * Syntax of ``query_parallel_or`` is as follow::

      query_parallel_or(match_columns, query_string1,
                                       query_string2,
                                       .
                                       .
                                       .
                                       query_stringN,
                                       {"option": "value", ...})

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Added support for ignoring nonexistent sort keys.

  * Groonga had been outputted error when we specified nonexistent sort keys until now.
    However, Groonga ignore nonexistent sort keys since this release. (Groonga doesn't output error.)
  * This feature implements for consistency.
    Because we just ignore invalid values in ``output_columns`` and most of invalid values in ``sort_keys``.

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Added support for ignoring nonexistent tables in ``drilldowns[].table``. [GitHub#1169][Reported by naoa]

  * Groonga had been outputted error when we specified nonexistent tables in ``drilldowns[].table`` until now.
    However, Groonga ignore nonexistent tables in ``drilldowns[].table`` since this release. (Groonga doesn't output error.)
  * This feature implements for consistency.
    Because we just ignore invalid values in ``output_columns`` and most of invalid values in ``sort_keys``.

* [httpd] Updated bundled nginx to 1.19.8.

Fixes
-----

* [:doc:`reference/commands/reference_acquire`] Fixed a bug that Groonga crash when a table's reference is acquired and a column is added to the table before auto release is happened.

  * Because the added column's reference isn't acquired but it's released on auto release.

* [Windows] Fixed a bug that one or more processes fail an output backtrace on SEGV when a new backtrace logging process starts when another backtrace logging process is running in another thread.


Known Issues
------------

* Currently, Groonga has a bug that there is possible that data is corrupt when we execute many additions, delete, and update data to vector column.

.. _release-11-0-0:

Release 11.0.0 - 2021-02-09
===========================

This is a major version up! But It keeps backward compatibility. We can upgrade to 11.0.0 without rebuilding database.

Improvements
------------

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Added support for outputting values of scalar column and vector column via nested index.

  * The nested index is that has structure as below.

    .. code-block::

      table_create Products TABLE_PAT_KEY ShortText

      table_create Purchases TABLE_NO_KEY
      column_create Purchases product COLUMN_SCALAR Products
      column_create Purchases tag COLUMN_SCALAR ShortText

      column_create Products purchases COLUMN_INDEX Purchases product

  * The ``Products.purchases`` column is a index of ``Purchases.product`` column in the above example.
    Also, ``Purchases.product`` is a reference to ``Products`` table.

  * We had not got the correct search result when we search via nested index until now.
  * The result had been as follows until now. We can see that ``{"product": "apple",  "tag": "man"}`` is not output.

    .. code-block::

      table_create Products TABLE_PAT_KEY ShortText

      table_create Purchases TABLE_NO_KEY

* [Windows] Dropped support for packages of Windows version that we had cross compiled by using MinGW on Linux.

  * Because there aren't probably many people who use that.
  * These above packages are that We had provided as below name until now.

    * ``groonga-x.x.x-x86.exe``
    * ``groonga-x.x.x-x86.zip``
    * ``groonga-x.x.x-x64.exe``
    * ``groonga-x.x.x-x86.zip``

  * From now on, we use the following packages for Windows.

    * ``groonga-latest-x86-vs2019-with-vcruntime.zip``
    * ``groonga-latest-x64-vs2019-with-vcruntime.zip``

  * If a system already has installed Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library, we suggest that we use the following packages.

    * ``groonga-latest-x86-vs2019.zip``
    * ``groonga-latest-x64-vs2019.zip``

Fixes
-----

* Fixed a bug that there is possible that index is corrupt when Groonga executes many additions, delete, and update information in it.

  * This bug occurs when we only execute many delete information from index.
    However, it doesn't occur when we only execute many additions information into index.

  * We can repair the index that is corrupt by this bug using reconstruction of it.

  * This bug doesn't detect unless we reference the broken index.
    Therefore, the index in our indexes may has already broken.

  * We can use [:doc:`reference/commands/index_column_diff`] command to confirm whether the index has already been broken or not.

.. _release-10-1-1:

Release 10.1.1 - 2021-01-25
===========================

Improvements
------------

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Added support for outputting UInt64 value in Apache Arrow format.

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Added support for outputting a number of hits in Apache Arrow format as below.

  .. code-block::

     -- metadata --
     GROONGA:n-hits: 10

* [:doc:`reference/functions/query`] Added support for optimization of "order by estimated size".

  * Normally, we can search at high speed when we first execute a condition which number of hits is a little.

    * The "B (There are few) && A (There are many)" faster than "A (There are many) && B (There are few)".

  * This is a known optimization. However we need reorder conditions by ourselves.
  * Groonga executes this reorder automatically by using optimization of "order by estimated size".
  * This optimization is valid by ``GRN_ORDER_BY_ESTIMATED_SIZE_ENABLE=yes``.

* [:doc:`/reference/functions/between`] Improved performance by the following improvements.

  * Improved the accuracy of a decision whether the ``between()`` use sequential search or not.
  * Improved that we set a result of ``between()`` into a result set in bulk.

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Improved performance for a prefix search.

  * For example, the performance of the following prefix search by using "*" improved.

    .. code-block::

       table_create Memos TABLE_PAT_KEY ShortText
       table_create Contents TABLE_PAT_KEY ShortText   --normalizer NormalizerAuto
       column_create Contents entries_key_index COLUMN_INDEX Memos _key

       load --table Memos
       [
       {"_key": "(groonga) Start to try!"},
       {"_key": "(mroonga) Installed"},
       {"_key": "(groonga) Upgraded!"}
       ]

       select \
         --table Memos \
         --match_columns _key \
         --query '\\(groonga\\)*'

* [:doc:`/reference/tokenizers`][TokenMecab] Improved performance for parallel construction fo token column. [GitHub#1158][Patched by naoa]

Fixes
-----

* [:doc:`reference/functions/sub_filter`] Fixed a bug that ``sub_filter`` doesn't work in ``slices[].filter``.

  * For example, the result of ``sub_filter`` was 0 records by the following query by this bug.

    .. code-block::

       table_create Users TABLE_HASH_KEY ShortText
       column_create Users age COLUMN_SCALAR UInt8

       table_create Memos TABLE_NO_KEY
       column_create Memos user COLUMN_SCALAR Users
       column_create Memos content COLUMN_SCALAR Text

       load --table Users
       [
       {"_key": "alice", "age": 9},
       {"_key": "bob",   "age": 29}
       ]

       load --table Memos
       [
       {"user": "alice", "content": "hello"},
       {"user": "bob",   "content": "world"},
       {"user": "alice", "content": "bye"},
       {"user": "bob",   "content": "yay"}
       ]

       select \
         --table Memos \
         --slices[adult].filter '_id > 1 && sub_filter(user, "age >= 18")'

* Fixed a bug that it is possible that we can't add data and Groonga crash when we repeat much addition of data and deletion of data against a hash table.

.. _release-10-1-0:

Release 10.1.0 - 2020-12-29
===========================

Improvements
------------

* [:doc:`/reference/functions/highlight_html`] Added support for removing leading full width spaces from highlight target. [PGroonga#GitHub#155][Reported by Hung Nguyen V]

  * Until now, leading full width spaces had also included in the target of highlight as below.

    .. code-block::

      table_create Entries TABLE_NO_KEY
      column_create Entries body COLUMN_SCALAR ShortText

      table_create Terms TABLE_PAT_KEY ShortText --default_tokenizer TokenBigram --normalizer NormalizerAuto
      column_create Terms document_index COLUMN_INDEX|WITH_POSITION Entries body

      load --table Entries
      [
      {"body": "Groonga　高速！"}
      ]

      select Entries --output_columns \
        --match_columns body --query '高速' \
        --output_columns 'highlight_html(body)'
      [
        [
          0,
          0.0,
          0.0
        ],
        [
          [
            [
              1
            ],
            [
              [
                "highlight_html",
                null
              ]
            ],
            [
              "Groonga<span class=\"keyword\">　高速</span>！"
            ]
          ]
        ]
      ]

  * However, this is needless as the target of highlight.
    Therefore, in this release, ``highlight_html()`` removes leading full width spaces.

* [:doc:`reference/commands/status`] Added a new item ``features``.

  * We can display which Groonga's features are enabled as below.

    .. code-block::

      }
    ]

  * This item only display when Apache Arrow is valid in Groonga.

* [:doc:`/reference/window_function`] Added support for processing all tables at once even if target tables straddle a shard. (experimental)

  * If the target tables straddle a shard, the window function had processed each shard until now.

    * Therefore, if we used multiple group keys in windows functions, the value of the group keys from the second had to be one kind of value.
    * However, we can use multiple kind of values for it as below by this improvement.

  * This feature requires Apache Arrow 3.0.0 that is not released yet.

* Added support for sequential search against reference column.

  * This feature is only used if an index search will match many records and the current result set is enough small.

    * Because the sequential search is faster than the index search in the above case.

  * It is invalid by default.
  * It is valid if we set ``GRN_II_SELECT_TOO_MANY_INDEX_MATCH_RATIO_REFERENCE`` environment variable.

  * ``GRN_II_SELECT_TOO_MANY_INDEX_MATCH_RATIO_REFERENCE`` environment variable is a threshold to switch the sequential search from the index search.

    * For example, if we set ``GRN_II_SELECT_TOO_MANY_INDEX_MATCH_RATIO_REFERENCE=0.7`` as below, if the number of records for the result set less than 70 % of total records, a search is executed by a sequential search.

* [tokenizers] Added support for the token column into ``TokenDocumentVectorTFIDF`` and ``TokenDocumentVectorBM25``.

  * If there is the token column that has the same source as the index column, these tokenizer use the token id of the token column.

    * The token column has already had data that has already finished tokenize.
    * Therefore, these tokenizer are improved performance by using a token column.

  * For example, we can use this feature by making a token column named ``content_tokens`` as below.

  * ``TokenDocumentVectorTFIDF`` and ``TokenDocumentVectorBM25`` give a weight against each tokens.

    * ``TokenDocumentVectorTFIDF`` calculate a weight for token by using TF-IDF.

	* Please refer to https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/tfidfmodel.html about TF-IDF.

    * ``TokenDocumentVectorBM25`` calculate a weight for token by using Okapi BM25.

	* Please refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25 about Okapi BM25.

* Improved performance when below case.

  * ``(column @ "value") && (column @ "value")``

* [:doc:`/install/ubuntu`] Added support for Ubuntu 20.10 (Groovy Gorilla).

* [:doc:`/install/debian`] Dropped stretch support.

  * It reached EOL.

.. _release-10-0-9:

Release 10.0.9 - 2020-12-01
===========================

Improvements
------------

* Improved performance when we specified ``-1`` to ``limit``.

* [:doc:`reference/commands/reference_acquire`] Added a new option ``--auto_release_count``.

  * Groonga reduces a reference count automatically when a request reaching the number of value that is specified in ``--auto_release_count``.

  * For example, the acquired reference of ``Users`` is released automatically after the second ``status`` is processed as below.

    .. code-block::

      reference_acquire --target_name Users --auto_release_count 2
      status # Users is still referred.
      status # Users' reference is released after this command is processed.

  * We can prevent a leak of the release of acquired reference by this option.

* Modify behavior when Groonga evaluated empty ``vector`` and ``uvector``.

  * Empty ``vector`` and ``uvector`` are evaluated to ``false`` in command version 3.

    * This behavior is valid for only command version 3.
    * Note that the different behavior until now.

* [:doc:`/reference/normalizers`] Added a new Normalizer ``NormalizerNFKC130`` based on Unicode NFKC (Normalization Form Compatibility Composition) for Unicode 13.0.

* [:doc:`/reference/token_filters`] Added a new TokenFilter ``TokenFilterNFKC130`` based on Unicode NFKC (Normalization Form Compatibility Composition) for Unicode 13.0.

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Improved performance for ``"_score = column - X"``.

* [:doc:`reference/commands/reference_acquire`] Improved that ``--reference_acquire`` doesn't get unnecessary reference of index column when we specify the ``--recursive dependent`` option.

  * From this release, the targets of ``--recursive dependent`` are only the target table's key  and the index column that is set to data column.

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Add support for ordered near phrase search.

  * Until now, the near phrase search have only looked for records that the distance of between specified phrases near.
  * This feature look for satisfy the following conditions records.

    * If the distance of between specified phrases is near.
    * If the specified phrases are in line with specified order.

  * This feature use ``*ONP`` as an operator. (Note that the operator isn't ``*NP``.)

  * ``$`` is handled as itself in the query syntax. Note that it isn't a special character in the query syntax.

  * If we use script syntax, this feature use as below.

    However, worker threads may not finish completely at this timing. Therefore, Groonga HTTP server may crashed according to timing. Because Groonga HTTP server may free area of memory that worker threads are using them yet.

.. _release-10-0-8:

Release 10.0.8 - 2020-10-29
===========================

Improvements
------------

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Added support for large drilldown keys.

  * The maximum on the key size of Groonga's tables are 4KiB.
    However, if we specify multiple keys in drilldown, the size of drilldown keys may be larger than 4KiB.

    * For example, if the total size for ``tag`` key and ``n_like`` key is lager than 4KiB in the following case,
      the drilldown had failed.

    .. code-block::

      select Entries \
        --limit -1 \
        --output_columns tag,n_likes \
        --drilldowns[tag.n_likes].keys tag,n_likes \
        --drilldowns[tag.n_likes].output_columns _value.tag,_value.n_likes,_nsubrecs

    * Because the drilldown packes specifying all keys for drilldown. So, if each the size of drilldown key is large,
      the size of the packed drilldown keys is larger than 4KiB.

  * This feature requires `xxHash <https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash>`_ .

    * However, if we install Groonga from package, we can use this feature without doing anything special.
      Because Groonga's package already include `xxHash <https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash>`_ .

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Added support for handling as the same dynamic column even if columns refer to different tables.

  * We can't have handled the same dynamic column if columns refer to different tables until now.
    Because the type of columns is different.

  * However, from this version, we can handle the same dynamic column even if columns refer to different tables by casting to built-in types as below.

    .. code-block::

      table_create Store_A TABLE_HASH_KEY ShortText
      table_create Store_B TABLE_HASH_KEY ShortText

      table_create Customers TABLE_HASH_KEY Int32
      column_create Customers customers_A COLUMN_VECTOR Store_A
      column_create Customers customers_B COLUMN_VECTOR Store_B

      load --table Customers
      [
        {"_key": 1604020694, "customers_A": ["A", "B", "C"]},
        {"_key": 1602724694, "customers_B": ["Z", "V", "Y", "T"]},
      ]

      select Customers \
        --filter '_key == 1604020694' \
        --columns[customers].stage output \
        --columns[customers].flags COLUMN_VECTOR \
        --columns[customers].type ShortText \
        --columns[customers].value 'customers_A' \
        --output_columns '_key, customers'

  * We have needed to set ``Store_A`` or ``Store_B`` in the ``type`` of ``customers`` column until now.
  * The type of ``customers_A`` column cast to ``ShortText`` in the above example.
  * By this, we can also set the value of ``customers_B`` in the value of ``customers`` column.
    Because both the key of ``customers_A`` and ``customers_B`` are ``ShortText`` type.

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Improved performance when the number of records for search result are huge.

  * This optimization works when below cases.

    * ``--filter 'column <= "value"'`` or ``--filter 'column >= "value"'``
    * ``--filter 'column == "value"'``
    * ``--filter 'between(...)'`` or ``--filter 'between(_key, ...)'``
    * ``--filter 'sub_filter(reference_column, ...)'``
    * Comparing against ``_key`` such as ``--filter '_key > "value"'``.
    * ``--filter 'geo_in_circle(...)'``

* Updated bundled LZ4 to 1.9.2 from 1.8.2.

* Added support xxHash 0.8

* [httpd] Updated bundled nginx to 1.19.4.

Fixes
-----

* Fixed the following bugs related the browser based administration tool. [GitHub#1139][Reported by sutamin]

  * The problem that Groonga's logo had not been displayed.
  * The problem that the throughput chart had not been displayed on the index page for Japanese.

* [:doc:`/reference/functions/between`] Fixed a bug that ``between(_key, ...)`` is always evaluated by sequential search.

Release 10.0.7 - 2020-09-29
===========================

Improvements
------------

* [highlight], [:doc:`/reference/functions/highlight_full`] Added support for normalizer options.

* [:doc:`/reference/command/return_code`] Added a new return code ``GRN_CONNECTION_RESET`` for resetting connection.

  * it is returned when an existing connection was forcibly close by the remote host.

* Dropped Ubuntu 19.10 (Eoan Ermine).

  * Because this version has been EOL.

* [httpd] Updated bundled nginx to 1.19.2.

* [:doc:`/reference/executables/grndb`] Added support for detecting duplicate keys.

  * ``grndb check`` is also able to detect duplicate keys since this release.
  * This check valid except a table of ``TABLE_NO_KEY``.
  * If the table that was detected duplicate keys by ``grndb check`` has only index columns, we can recover by ``grndb recover``.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/table_create`], [:doc:`/reference/commands/column_create`] Added a new option ``--path``

  * We can store specified a table or a column to any path using this option.
  * This option is useful if we want to store a table or a column that
    we often use to fast storage (e.g. SSD) and store them that we don't often
    use to slow storage (e.g. HDD).
  * We can specify both relative path and absolute path in this option.

    * If we specify relative path in this option, the path is resolved the path of ``groonga`` process as the origin.

  * However, if we specify ``--path``, the result of ``dump`` command includes ``--path`` informations.

    * Therefore, if we specify ``--path``, we can't restore to host in different enviroment.

      * Because the directory configuration and the location of ``groonga`` process in different by each enviroment.

    * If we don't want include ``--path`` informations to a dump, we need specify ``--dump_paths no`` in ``dump`` command.

* [:doc:`reference/commands/dump`] Added a new option ``--dump_paths``.

  * ``--dump_paths`` option control whether ``--path`` is dumped or not.
  * The default value of it is ``yes``.
  * If we specify ``--path`` when we create tables or columns and we don't want include ``--path`` informations to a dump, we specify ``no`` into ``--dump_paths`` when we execute ``dump`` command.

* [functions] Added a new function ``string_toknize()``.

  * It tokenizes the column value that is specified in the second argument with the tokenizer that is specified in the first argument.

* [tokenizers] Added a new tokenizer ``TokenDocumentVectorTFIDF`` (experimental).

  * It generates automatically document vector by TF-IDF.

* [tokenizers] Added a new tokenizer ``TokenDocumentVectorBM25`` (experimental).

  * It generates automatically document vector by BM25.

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Added support for near search in same sentence.

Fixes
-----

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/load`] Fixed a bug that ``load`` didn't a return response when we executed it against 257 columns.

  * This bug may occur from 10.0.4 or later.
  * This bug only occur when we load data by using ``[a, b, c, ...]`` format.

    * If we load data by using ``[{...}]``, this bug doesn't occur.

* [MessagePack] Fixed a bug that float32 value wasn't unpacked correctly.

* Fixed the following bugs related multi column index.

  * ``_score`` may be broken with full text search.
  * The records that couldn't hit might hit.
  * Please refer to the following URL for the details about occurrence conditionin of this bug.

    * https://groonga.org/en/blog/2020/09/29/groonga-10.0.7.html#multi-column-index

.. _release-10-0-6:

Release 10.0.6 - 2020-08-29
===========================

Improvements
------------

* [:doc:`reference/commands/logical_range_filter`] Improved search plan for large data.

  * Normally, ``logical_range_filter`` is faster than ``logical_select``.
    However, it had been slower than ``logical_select`` in the below case.

    * If Groonga can't get the number of required records easily, it has the feature that switches index search from sequential search. (Normally, ``logical_range_filter`` uses a sequential search when records of search target are many.)
    * The search process for it is almost the same as ``logical_select`` if the above switching occurred.
      So, ``logical_range_filter`` is severalfold slower than ``logical_select`` in the above case if the search target is large data.
      Because ``logical_range_filter`` executes sort after the search.

  * If we search for large data, Groonga easily use sequential search than until now since this release.
  * Therefore, ``logical_range_filter`` will improve performance. Because the case of the search process almost the same as ``logical_select`` decreases.

* [httpd] Updated bundled nginx to 1.19.1.

* Modify how to install into Debian GNU/Linux.

  * We modify to use ``groonga-apt-source`` instead of ``groonga-archive-keyring``. Because the ``lintian`` command recommends using ``apt-source`` if a package that it puts files under the ``/etc/apt/sources.lists.d/``.

    * The ``lintian`` command is the command which checks for many common packaging errors.
    * Please also refer to the following URL for the details about installation procedures.

      * https://groonga.org/docs/install/debian.html

* [:doc:`reference/commands/logical_select`] Added a support for ``highlight_html`` and ``highlight_full`` .

* Added support for recycling the IDs of records that are deleted when an array without value space delete.[GitHub#mroonga/mroonga#327][Reported by gaeeyo]

  * If an array that doesn't have value space is deleted, deleted IDs are never recycled.
  * Groonga had used large storage space by large ID. Because it uses large storage space by itself.

    * For example, large ID is caused after many adds and deletes like Mroonga's ``mroonga_operations``

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Improved performance of full-text-search without index.

* [:doc:`reference/function`] Improved performance for calling of function that all arguments a variable reference or literal.

* [:doc:`reference/indexing`] Improved performance of offline index construction by using token column. [GitHub#1126][Patched by naoa]

* Improved performance for ``"_score = func(...)"``.

  * The performance when the ``_score`` value calculate by using only function like ``"_score = func(...)"`` improved.

Fixes
-----

* Fixed a bug that garbage may be included in response after response send error.

  * It may occur if a client didn't read all responses and closed the connection.

Release 10.0.5 - 2020-07-30
===========================

Improvements
------------

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Added support for storing reference in table that we specify with ``--load_table``.

  * ``--load_table`` is a feature that stores search results to the table in a prepared.

    * If the searches are executed multiple times, we can cache the search results by storing them to this table.
    * We can shorten the search times that the search after the first time by using this table.

  * We can store a reference to other tables into the key of this table as below since this release.

    * We can make a smaller size of this table. Because we only store references without store column values.
    * If we search against this table, we can search by using indexes for reference destination.

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Improved sort performance on below cases.

  * When many sort keys need ID resolution.

    * For example, the following expression needs ID resolution.

      * ``--filter true --sort_keys column``

    * For example, the following expression doesn't need ID resolution.
      Because the ``_score`` pseudo column exists in the result table not the source table.

      * ``--filter true --sort_keys _score``

  * When a sort target table has a key.

    * Therefore, ``TABLE_NO_KEY`` isn't supported this improvement.

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Improved performance a bit on below cases.

  * A case of searching for many records matches.
  * A case of drilldown for many records.

* [aggregator] Added support for score accessor for target. [GitHub#1120][Patched by naoa]

  * For example, we can ``_score`` subject to ``aggregator_*`` as below.

    * We can also calculate sample standard deviation to specifing ``aggregate_sd(target, {"unbiased": true})``.

* [Windows] Dropped Visual Studio 2013 support.

Fixes
-----

* [:doc:`reference/executables/groonga-server-http`] Fixed a bug that a request can't halt even if we execute ``shutdown?mode=immediate`` when the response was halted by error occurrence.

* Fixed a crash bug when an error occurs while a request.

  * It only occurs when we use Apache Arrow Format.
  * Groonga crashes when we send request to Groonga again after the previous request was halted by error occurrence.

* [:doc:`/reference/functions/between`] Fixed a crash bug when temporary table is used.

  * For example, if we specify a dynamic column in the first argument for ``between``, Groonga had crashed.

* Fixed a bug that procedure created by plugin is freed unexpectedly.

  * It's only occurred in reference count mode.
  * It's not occurred if we don't use ``plugin_register``.
  * It's not occurred in the process that executes ``plugin_register``.
  * It's occurred in the process that doesn't execute ``plugin_register``.

* Fixed a bug that normalization error occurred while static index construction by ``token_column``. [GitHub#1122][Reported by naoa]

Release 10.0.4 - 2020-06-29
===========================

Improvements
------------

* [:doc:`reference/tables`] Added support for registering 400M records into a hash table.

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Improve scorer performance when the ``_score`` doesn't get recursively values.

  * Groonga get recursively value of ``_score`` when search result is search target.
  * For example, the search targets of ``slices`` are search result. Therefore, if we use ``slice`` in a query, this improvement doesn't ineffective.

* [:doc:`reference/log`] Improved that we output drilldown keys in query-log.

* [:doc:`reference/commands/reference_acquire`], [:doc:`reference/commands/reference_release`] Added new commands for reference count mode.

  * If we need to call multiple ``load`` in a short time, auto close by the reference count mode will degrade performance.
  * We can avoid the performance degrading by calling ``reference_acquire`` before multiple ``load`` and calling ``reference_release`` after multiple ``load``.
    Between ``reference_acquire`` and ``reference_release``, auto close is disabled.

    * Because ``reference_acquire`` acquires a reference of target objects.

  * We can must call ``reference_release`` after you finish performance impact operations.
  * If we don't call ``reference_release``, the reference count mode doesn't work.

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Added support for aggregating multiple groups on one time ``drilldown``.

  * We came to be able to calculate sum or arithmetic mean every different multiple groups on one time ``drilldown`` as below.

* [:doc:`reference/executables/groonga`] Added support for ``--pid-path`` in standalone mode.

  * Because ``--pid-path`` had been ignored in standalone mode in before version.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/io_flush`] Added support for reference count mode.

* [:doc:`reference/commands/logical_range_filter`], [:doc:`/reference/commands/logical_count`] Added support for reference count mode.

* [:doc:`reference/executables/groonga-server-http`] We didn't add header after the last chunk.

  * Because there is a possibility to exist that the HTTP client ignores header after the last chunk.

* [vector_slice] Added support for a vector that has the value of the ``Float32`` type. [GitHub#1112 patched by naoa]

* Added support for parallel offline index construction using token column.

  * We came to be able to construct an offline index on parallel threads from data that are tokenized in advance.

  * We can tune parameters of parallel offline construction by the following environment variables

    * ``GRN_TOKEN_COLUMN_PARALLEL_CHUNK_SIZE`` : We specify how many records are processed per thread.

      * The default value is ``1024`` records.

    * ``GRN_TOKEN_COLUMN_PARALLEL_TABLE_SIZE_THRESHOLD`` : We specify how many source records are required for parallel offline construction.

      * The default value is ``102400`` records.

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Improved performance for ``load_table`` on the reference count mode.

Fixes
-----

* Fixed a bug that the database of Groonga was broken when we search by using the dynamic columns that don't specify a ``--filter`` and stridden over shard.

* Fixed a bug that ``Float32`` type had not displayed on a result of ``schema`` command.

* Fixed a bug that we count in surplus to ``_nsubrecs`` when the reference ``uvector`` hasn't element.

.. _release-10-0-3:

Release 10.0.3 - 2020-05-29
===========================

Improvements
------------

* We came to be able to construct an inverted index from data that are tokenized in advance.

  * The construct of an index is speeded up from this.
  * We need to prepare token column to use this improvement.
  * token column is an auto generated value column like an index column.
  * token column value is generated from source column value by tokenizing the source column value.

  * We can create a token column by setting the source column as below.

    .. code-block::

      table_create Terms TABLE_PAT_KEY ShortText \
        --normalizer NormalizerNFKC121 \
        --default_tokenizer TokenNgram

      table_create Notes TABLE_NO_KEY
      column_create Notes title COLUMN_SCALAR Text

      # The last "title" is the source column.
      column_create Notes title_terms COLUMN_VECTOR Terms title

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] We came to be able to specify a ``vector`` for the argument of a function.

  * For example, ``flags`` options of ``query`` can describe by a ``vector`` as below.

    .. code-block::

      select \
        --table Memos \
        --filter 'query("content", "-content:@mroonga", \
                        { \
                          "expander": "QueryExpanderTSV", \
                          "flags": ["ALLOW_LEADING_NOT", "ALLOW_COLUMN"] \
                        })'

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Added a new stage ``result_set`` for dynamic columns.

  * This stage generates a column into a result set table. Therefore, it is not generated if ``query`` or ``filter`` doesn't exist

    * Because if ``query`` or ``filter`` doesn't exist, Groonga doesn't make a result set table.

  * We can't use ``_value`` for the stage. The ``result_set`` stage is for storing value by ``score_column``.

* [vector_slice] Added support for weight vector that has weight of ``Float32`` type. [GitHub#1106 patched by naoa]

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Added support for ``filtered`` stage and ``output`` stage of dynamic columns on drilldowns. [GitHub#1101 patched by naoa][GitHub#1100 patched by naoa]

  * We can use ``filtered`` and ``output`` stage of dynamic columns on drilldowns as with ``drilldowns[Label].stage filtered`` and ``drilldowns[Label].stage output``.

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Added support for ``Float`` type value in aggregating on drilldown.

  * We can aggregate max value, min value, and sum value for ``Float`` type value using ``MAX``, ``MIN``, and ``SUM``.

* [:doc:`reference/functions/query`] [:doc:`reference/functions/geo_in_rectangle`] [:doc:`reference/functions/geo_in_circle`] Added a new option ``score_column`` for ``query()``, ``geo_in_rectangle()``, and ``geo_in_circle()``.

  * We can store a score value by condition using ``score_column``.
  * Normally, Groonga calculate a score by adding scores of all conditions. However, we sometimes want to get a score value by condition.
  * For example, if we want to only use how near central coordinate as score as below, we use ``score_column``.

  * The sort by ``_score`` is meaningless in the above example. Because the value of ``_score`` is all ``1`` by ``category == "Tower"``.
    However, we can sort distance from central coordinate using ``score_column``.

* [Windows] Groonga came to be able to output backtrace when it occurs error even if it doesn't crash.

* [Windows] Dropped support for old Windows.

  * Groonga for Windows come to require Windows 8 (Windows Server 2012) or later from 10.0.3.

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Improved sort performance when sort keys were mixed referable sort keys and the other sort keys.

  * We improved sort performance if mixed referable sort keys and the other and there are referable keys two or more.

    * Referable sort keys are sort keys that except below them.

      * Compressed columns
      * ``_value`` against the result of drilldown that is specified multiple values to the key of drilldown.
      * ``_key`` against patricia trie table that has not the key of ``ShortText`` type.
      * ``_score``

  * The more sort keys that except string, a decrease in the usage of memory for sort.

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Improved sort performance when sort keys are all referable keys case.

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Improve scorer performance as a ``_socre = column1*X + column2*Y + ...`` case.

  * This optimization effective when there are many ``+`` or ``*`` in ``_score``.
  * At the moment, it has only effective against ``+`` and ``*``.

* [:doc:`reference/commands/select`] Added support for phrase near search.

  * We can search phrase by phrase by a near search.

    * Query syntax for near phrase search is ``*NP"Phrase1 phrase2 ..."``.
    * Script syntax for near phrase search is ``column *NP "phrase1 phrase2 ..."``.

    * If the search target phrase includes space, we can search for it by surrounding it with ``"`` as below.

* [:doc:`reference/columns/vector`] Added support for ``float32`` weight vector.

  * We can store weight as ``float32`` instead of ``uint32``.
  * We need to add ``WEIGHT_FLOAT32`` flag when execute ``column_create`` to use this feature.

    .. code-block::

       column_create Records tags COLUMN_VECTOR|WITH_WEIGHT|WEIGHT_FLOAT32 Tags

  * However, ``WEIGHT_FLOAT32`` flag isn't available with ``COLUMN_INDEX`` flag for now.

* Added following APIs

  * Added ``grn_obj_is_xxx`` functions. For more information as below.

    * ``grn_obj_is_weight_vector(grn_ctx *ctx, grn_obj *obj)``

      * It returns as a ``bool`` whether the object is a weight vector.

    * ``grn_obj_is_uvector(grn_ctx *ctx, grn_obj *obj)``

    * It returns the size of Groonga data type as a ``size_t``.

  * Added ``grn_selector_data_get_xxx`` functions. For more information as below.

    * These functions return selector related data.

      * These functions are supposed to call in selector. If they are called except in selector, they return ``NULL``.

        * ``grn_selector_data_get(grn_ctx *ctx)``

          * It returns all information that relating calling selector as ``grn_selector_data *`` structure.

        * ``grn_selector_data_get_selector(grn_ctx *ctx, grn_selector_data *data)``

          * It returns selector itself as ``grn_obj *``.

        * ``grn_selector_data_get_expr(grn_ctx *ctx, grn_selector_data *data)``

          * It returns selector is used ``--filter`` condition and ``--query`` condition as ``grn_obj *``.

        * ``grn_selector_data_get_table(grn_ctx *ctx, grn_selector_data *data)``

          * It returns target table as ``grn_obj *``

        * ``grn_selector_data_get_index(grn_ctx *ctx, grn_selector_data *data)``

          * It returns index is used by selector as ``grn_obj *``.

        * ``grn_selector_data_get_args(grn_ctx *ctx, grn_selector_data *data, size_t *n_args)``

          * It returns result table as ``grn_obj *``.

        * ``grn_selector_data_get_op(grn_ctx *ctx, grn_selector_data *data)``

          * It returns how to perform the set operation on existing result set as ``grn_operator``.

  * Added ``grn_plugin_proc_xxx`` functions. For more information as below.

    * ``grn_plugin_proc_get_value_operator(grn_ctx *ctx, grn_obj *value, grn_operator default_operator, const char *context)``

      * It returns the operator of a query as a ``grn_operator``.

        * For example, ``&&`` is returned as a ``GRN_OP_AND``.


    * ``grn_plugin_proc_get_value_bool(grn_ctx *ctx, grn_obj *value, bool default_value, const char *tag)``

      * It returns the value that is specified ``true`` or ``false`` like ``with_transposition`` argument of the below function as a ``bool`` (``bool`` is the data type of C language).

        .. code-block::

           fuzzy_search(column, query, {"max_distance": 1, "prefix_length": 0, "max_expansion": 0, "with_transposition": true})

  * Added ``grn_proc_options_xxx`` functions. For more information as below.

    * ``query()`` only uses them for now.

      * ``grn_proc_options_parsev(grn_ctx *ctx, grn_obj *options, const char *tag, const char *name, va_list args)``

        * This function execute parse options.
        * We had to implement parsing to options ourselves until now, however, we can parse them by just call this function from this version.

      * ``grn_proc_options_parse(grn_ctx *ctx, grn_obj *options, const char *tag, const char *name, ...)``

        * It calls ``grn_proc_options_parsev()``. Therefore, features of this function same ``grn_proc_options_parsev()``.
        * It only differs in the interface compare with ``grn_proc_options_parsev()``.

  * Added ``grn_text_printfv(grn_ctx *ctx, grn_obj *bulk, const char *format, va_list args)``

    * ``grn_text_vprintf`` is deprecated from 10.0.3. We use ``grn_text_printfv`` instead.

  * Added ``grn_type_id_is_float_family(grn_ctx *ctx, grn_id id)``.

    * It returns whether ``grn_type_id`` is ``GRN_DB_FLOAT32`` or ``GRN_DB_FLOAT`` or not as a ``bool``.

    * It returns the number of max records the cursor can have as a ``size_t``. (This API is for the DAT table)

  * Added ``grn_table_cursor_get_max_n_records(grn_ctx *ctx, grn_table_cursor *cursor)``.

    * It returns the number of max records the cursor can have as a ``size_t``.
    * It can use against all table type (``TABLE_NO_KEY``, ``TABLE_HASH_KEY``, ``TABLE_DAT_KEY``, and ``TABLE_PAT_KEY``).

  * Added ``grn_result_set_add_xxx`` functions. For more information as below.

    * ``grn_result_set_add_record(grn_ctx *ctx, grn_hash *result_set, grn_posting *posting, grn_operator op)``

      * It adds a record into the table of result sets.
      * ``grn_ii_posting_add_float`` is deprecated from 10.0.3. We use ``grn_rset_add_records()`` instead.

    * ``grn_result_set_add_table(grn_ctx *ctx, grn_hash *result_set, grn_obj *table, double score, grn_operator op)``

      * It adds a table into the result sets.

    * ``grn_result_set_add_table_cursor(grn_ctx *ctx, grn_hash *result_set, grn_table_cursor *cursor, double score, grn_operator op)``

      * It adds records that a table cursor has into the result sets.

  * Added ``grn_vector_copy(grn_ctx *ctx, grn_obj *src, grn_obj *dest)``.

    * It copies a ``vector`` object. It returns whether success copy a ``vector`` object.

    * It's for bulk result set insert. It's faster than inserting records by ``grn_ii_posting_add()``.

Fixes
-----

* Fixed a crash bug if the modules (tokenizers, normalizers, and token filters) are used at the same time from multiple threads.

* Fixed precision of ``Float32`` value when it outputted.

  * The precision of it changes to  8-digit to 7-digit from 10.0.3.

* Fixed a bug that Groonga used the wrong cache when the query that just the parameters of dynamic column different was executed. [GitHub#1102 patched by naoa]

.. _release-10-0-2:

Release 10.0.2 - 2020-04-29
===========================

Improvements
------------

* Added support for ``uvector`` for ``time_classify_*`` functions. [GitHub#1089][Patched by naoa]

  * ``uvector`` is a vector that size of elements for vector are fixed.
  * For example, a vector that has values of Time type as elements is a ``uvector``.

* Improve sort performance if sort key that can't refer value with zero-copy is mixed.

  * Some sort key (e.g. ``_score``) values can't be referred with zero-copy.
  * If there is at least one sort key that can't be referable is included, all sort keys are copied before.
  * With this change, we just copy sort keys that can't be referred. Referable sort keys are just referred without a copy.
  * However, this change may have performance regression when all sort keys are referable.

* Added support for loading weight vector as a JSON string.

  * We can load weight vector as a JSON string as below example.

    .. code-block::

       table_create Tags TABLE_PAT_KEY ShortText
       table_create Data TABLE_NO_KEY
       column_create Data tags COLUMN_VECTOR|WITH_WEIGHT Tags
       column_create Tags data_tags COLUMN_INDEX|WITH_WEIGHT Data tags
       load --table Data
       [
         {"tags": "{\"fruit\": 10, \"apple\": 100}"},
         {"tags": "{\"fruit\": 200}"}
       ]

* Added support for ``Float32`` type.

  * Groonga already has a ``Float`` type. However, it is double precision floating point number. Therefore if we only use single precision floating point number, it is not efficient.
  * We can select more suitable type by adding a ``Float32`` type.

* Added following APIs

  * ``grn_obj_unref(grn_ctx *ctx, grn_obj *obj)``

    * This API is only used on the reference count mode (The reference count mode is a state of ``GRN_ENABLE_REFERENCE_COUNT=yes``.).

      * It calls ``grn_obj_unlink()`` only on the reference count mode. It doesn't do anything except when the reference count mode.
      * We useful it when we need only call ``grn_obj_unlink()`` on the referece count mode.
      * Because as the following example, we don't write condition that whether the reference count mode or not.

        * The example if we don't use ``grn_obj_unref()``.

          .. code-block::

             if (grn_enable_reference_count) {
              grn_obj_unlink(ctx, obj);
             }

        * The example if we use ``grn_obj_unref()``.

          .. code-block::

             grn_obj_ubref(ctx, obj);

  * ``grn_get_version_major(void)``
  * ``grn_get_version_minor(void)``
  * ``grn_get_version_micro(void)``

    * They return Groonga's major, minor, and micor version numbers as a ``uint32_t``.

  * ``grn_posting_get_record_id(grn_ctx *ctx, grn_posting *posting)``
  * ``grn_posting_get_section_id(grn_ctx *ctx, grn_posting *posting)``
  * ``grn_posting_get_position(grn_ctx *ctx, grn_posting *posting)``
  * ``grn_posting_get_tf(grn_ctx *ctx, grn_posting *posting)``
  * ``grn_posting_get_weight(grn_ctx *ctx, grn_posting *posting)``
  * ``grn_posting_get_weight_float(grn_ctx *ctx, grn_posting *posting)``
  * ``grn_posting_get_rest(grn_ctx *ctx, grn_posting *posting)``

    * They return information on the posting list.
    * These APIs return value as a ``uint32_t`` except ``grn_posting_get_weight_float``.
    * ``grn_posting_get_weight_float`` returns value as a ``float``.

    * ``grn_posting_get_section_id(grn_ctx *ctx, grn_posting *posting)``

      * Section id is the internal representation of the column name.
      * If column name store in posting list as a string, it is a large amount of information and it use waste capacity.
      * Therefore, Groonga compresses the amount of information and use storage capacity is small by storing column name in the posting list as a number called section id.

    * ``grn_posting_get_tf(grn_ctx *ctx, grn_posting *posting)``

      * ``tf`` of ``grn_posting_get_tf`` is Term Frequency score.

    * ``grn_posting_get_weight_float(grn_ctx *ctx, grn_posting *posting)``

      * It returns weight of token as a ``float``.
      * We suggest using this API when we get a weight of token after this.

        * Because we modify the internal representation of the weight from ``uint32_t`` to ``float`` in the near future.

Fixes
-----

* Fixed a bug that Groonga for 32bit on GNU/Linux may crash.

* Fixed a bug that unrelated column value may be cleared. [GtiHub#1087][Reported by sutamin]

* Fixed a memory leak when we dumped records with ``dump`` command.

* Fixed a memory leak when we specified invalid value into ``output_columns``.

* Fixed a memory leak when we executed ``snippet`` function.

* Fixed a memory leak when we filled the below conditions.

  * If we used dynamic columns on the ``initial`` stage.
  * If we used ``slices`` argument with ``select`` command.

* Fixed a memory leak when we deleted tables with ``logical_table_remove``.

* Fixed a memory leak when we use the reference count mode.

  * The reference count mode is a ``GRN_ENABLE_REFERENCE_COUNT=yes`` state.
  * This mode is experimental. Performance may degrade by this mode.

* Fixed a bug that Groonga too much unlink ``_key`` accessor when we load data for apache arrow format.

.. _release-10-0-1:

Release 10.0.1 - 2020-03-30
===========================

We have been released Groonga 10.0.1.
Because Ubuntu and Windows(VC++ version) package in Groonga 10.0.0 were mistaken.

If we have already used Groonga 10.0.0 for CentOS, Debian, Windows(MinGW version), no problem with continued use it.

Fixes
-----

* Added a missing runtime(vcruntime140_1.dll) in package for Windows VC++ version.

.. _release-10-0-0:

Release 10.0.0 - 2020-03-29
===========================

Improvements
------------

* [httpd] Updated bundled nginx to 1.17.9.

* [httpd] Added support for specifying output type as an extension.

  * For example, we can write ``load.json`` instead of ``load?output_type=json``.

* [:doc:`reference/log`] Outputted a path of opened or closed file into a log of dump level on Linux.

* [:doc:`reference/log`] Outputted a path of closed file into a log of debug level on Windows.  

* Added following API and macros

  * ``grn_timeval_from_double(grn_ctx, double)``

    * This API converts ``double`` type to ``grn_timeval`` type.
    * It returns value of ``grn_timeval`` type.

  * ``GRN_TIMEVAL_TO_NSEC(timeval)``

    * This macro converts value of ``grn_timeval`` type to nanosecond as the value of ``uint64_t`` type.

  * ``GRN_TIME_USEC_TO_SEC(usec)``

    * This macro converts microsecond to second.

* Deprecated the following macro.

  * ``GRN_OBJ_FORMAT_FIN(grn_ctx, grn_obj_format)``

    * We ``grn_obj_format_fin(grn_ctx, grn_obj_format)`` use instead since 10.0.0.

* [:doc:`reference/commands/logical_range_filter`],[:doc:`reference/commands/dump`] Added support for stream output.

  * This feature requires ``command_version 3`` or later. The header content is outputted after the body content.
  * Currently, this feature support only ``dump`` and ``logical_range_filter``.
  * ``logical_range_filter`` always returns the output as a stream on ``command_version 3`` or later.
  * This feature has the following limitations.

    * -1 is only allowed for negative ``limit``
    * MessagePack output isn't supported

  * We a little changed the response contents of JSON by this modify.

    * The key order differs from before versions as below.

      * The key order in before versions.

        .. code-block::

          {
            "header": {...},
            "body": {...}
          }

      * The key order in this version(10.0.0).

        .. code-block::

          {
            "body": {...},
            "header": {...}
          }

  * Disabled caches of ``dump`` and ``logical_range_filter`` when they execute on ``command_version 3``.

    * Because of ``dump`` and ``logical_range_filter`` on ``command_version 3`` returns stream since 10.0.0, Groonga can not cache the whole response.

* [:doc:`reference/commands/logical_range_filter`] Added support for outputting response as Apache Arrow format.

  * Supported data type as below.

    * ``UInt8``
    * ``Int8``
    * ``UInt16``
    * ``Int16``
    * ``UInt32``
    * ``Int32``
    * ``UInt64``
    * ``Int64``
    * ``Time``
    * ``ShortText``
    * ``Text``
    * ``LongText``
    * ``Vector`` of ``Int32``
    * ``Reference vector``

* Supported Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa).

* Dropped Ubuntu 19.04 (Disco Dingo).

  * Because this version has been EOL.

.. _release-9-1-2:

Release 9.1.2 - 2020-01-29
==========================

Improvements
------------

* [tools] Added a script for copying only files of specify tables or columns.

  * This script name is copy-related-files.rb.
  * This script is useful if we want to extract specifying tables or columns from a huge database.
  * Related files of specific tables or columns may need for reproducing fault.
  * If we difficult to offer a database whole, we can extract related files of target tables or columns by this tool. 

* [:doc:`reference/commands/shutdown`] Accept ``/d/shutdown?mode=immediate`` immediately even when all threads are used.

  * This feature can only use on the Groonga HTTP server.

* Unused objects free immediately by using ``GRN_ENABLE_REFERENCE_COUNT=yes``.

  * This feature is experimental. Performance degrade by this feature.
  * If we load to span many tables, we can expect to keep in the usage of memory by this feature.

* [:doc:`/install/centos`] We prepare ``groonga-release`` by version.

  * Note that the little modification how to install.

* [:doc:`/install/debian`] We use ``groonga-archive-keyring`` for adding the Groonga apt repository.

  * We can easy to add the Groonga apt repository to our system by this improvement.
  * ``groonga-archive-keyring`` includes all information for using the Groonga apt repository. Thus, we need not be conscious of changing of repository information or PGP key by installing this package.
  * ``groonga-archive-keyring`` is deb package. Thus, we can easy to update by ``apt update``.

.. _release-9-1-1:

Release 9.1.1 - 2020-01-07
==========================

Improvements
------------

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/load`] Added support for Apache Arrow format data.

  * If we use Apache Arrow format data, we may reduce parse cost. Therefore, data might be loading faster than other formats.
  * Groonga can also directly input data for Apache Arrow format from other data analysis systems by this improvement.
  * However, Apache Arrow format can use in the HTTP interface only. We can't use it in the command line interface.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/load`] Added how to load Apache Arrow format data in the document.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/load`] Improve error message.

  * Response of ``load`` command includes error message also.
  * If we faile data load, Groonga output error detail of ``load`` command by this Improvement.

* [httpd] Updated bundled nginx to 1.17.7.

* [:doc:`reference/executables/groonga-server-http`] Added support for sending command parameters by body of HTTP request.

  * We must set ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` to ``Content-Type`` for this case.

* [:doc:`reference/executables/groonga-server-http`] Added how to use HTTP POST in the document.

==========================

Improvements
------------

* Improved the performance of the "&&" operation.

  * For example, the performance of condition expression such as the following is increased.

  * ( A || B ) && ( C || D ) && ( E || F) ...

* [:doc:`/reference/tokenizers/token_mecab`] Added a new option ``use_base_form``

  * We can search using the base form of a token by this option.

Improvements
------------

* [:doc:`reference/commands/log_reopen`] Added a supplementary explanation when we use ``groonga-httpd`` with 2 or more workers.

  * ``sub_filter`` was an error if the above situation in before
    version.
  * From this version, ``sub_filter`` returns search results if the above situation.
  * However if the above situation, ``sub_filter`` is slow. Because it is executed as a sequential search.

  * If you specify a tokenizer like ``TokenNgram`` or ``TokenMecab`` etc that has options, you can output these options with ``table_list`` command.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/select`] Supported normalizer options in sequential match with ``record @ 'query'``.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/truncate`] Supported a table that it has tokenizer option.

  * You can ``truncate`` even a tabel that it has tokenizer like ``TokenNgram`` or ``TokenMecab`` etc that has options.

* [:doc:`/reference/tokenizers`][TokenMecab] Added new option ``target_class``

  * This option searches a token of specifying a part-of-speech. For example, you can search only a noun.
  * This option can also specify subclasses and exclude or add specific part-of-speech of specific using ``+`` or ``-``. So, you can also search except a pronoun as below.

    ``'TokenMecab("target_class", "-名詞/代名詞", "target_class", "+")'``

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/io_flush`] Supported locking of a database during a ``io_flush``.

  * Because Groonga had a problem taht is a crash when deleteing a table of a target of a ``io_flush`` during execution of a ``io_flush``.

* [:doc:`/reference/functions/cast_loose`] Added a new function ``cast_loose``.

  * This function cast to a type to specify. If a value to specify can't cast, it become to a default value to specify.

* Added optimize the order of evaluation of a conditional expression.(experimental)

  * You can active this feature by setting environment value as below.

    ``GRN_EXPR_OPTIMIZE=yes``

* Supported ``(?-mix:XXX)`` form for index searchable regular expression. [groonga-dev,04683][Reported by Masatoshi SEKI]

  * ``(?-mix:XXX)`` form treats the same as XXX.

* [httpd] Updated bundled nginx to 1.15.5.

* Supported Ubuntu 18.10 (Cosmic Cuttlefish)

Fixes
-----

.. _release-8-0-7:

Release 8.0.7 - 2018-09-29
==========================

Improvements
------------

* [:doc:`/reference/tokenizers`][TokenMecab] support outputting metadata of Mecab.

  * Added new option ``include_class`` for ``TokenMecab``.

    This option outputs ``class`` and ``subclass`` in Mecab's metadata.

  * Added new option ``include_reading`` for ``TokenMecab``.

    This option outputs ``reading`` in Mecab's metadata.

  * Added new option ``include_form`` for ``TokenMecab``.

    This option outputs ``inflected_type``, ``inflected_form`` and ``base_form`` in Mecab's metadata.

  * Added new option ``use_reading`` for ``TokenMecab``.

    This option supports a search by kana.

    This option is useful for countermeasure of orthographical variants because it searches with kana.

* [plugin] Groonga now can grab plugins from multiple directories.

  You can specify multiple directories to ``GRN_PLUGINS_PATH`` separated with ":" on non Windows, ";" on Windows.

  ``GRN_PLUGINS_PATH`` has high priority than the existing ``GRN_PLUGINS_DIR``.
  Currently, this option is not supported Windows.

* [:doc:`/reference/tokenizers`][TokenNgram] Added new option ``unify_alphabet`` for ``TokenNgram``.

  If we use ``unify_alphabet`` as ``false``, ``TokenNgram`` uses bigram tokenize method for ASCII character.

* [:doc:`/reference/tokenizers`][TokenNgram] Added new option ``unify_symbol`` for ``TokenNgram``.

  ``TokenNgram("unify_symbol", false)`` is same behavior of ``TokenBigramSplitSymbol``.

* [:doc:`/reference/tokenizers`][TokenNgram] Added new option ``unify_digit`` for ``TokenNgram``.

  If we use ``unify_digit`` as ``false``, If we set false, ``TokenNgram`` uses bigram tokenize method for digits.

* [httpd] Updated bundled nginx to 1.15.4.

Fixes
-----

* Fixed wrong score calculations on some cases.

  * It's caused when adding, multiplication or division numeric to a bool value.
  * It's caused when comparing a scalar and vector columns using ``!=`` or ``==``.

.. _release-8-0-6:

Release 8.0.6 - 2018-08-29
==========================

Improvements
------------

* [:doc:`/reference/tokenizers`][TokenMecab] add ``chunked_tokenize`` and ``chunk_size_threshold`` options.

* [optimizer] support estimation for query family expressions.
  It will generate more effective execution plan with query family expressions such as ``column @ query``, ``column @~ pattern`` and so on.

* [optimizer] plug-in -> built-in
  It's disabled by default for now.
  We can enable it by defining ``GRN_EXPR_OPTIMIZE=yes`` environment variable or using ``expression_rewriters`` table as before.

* Enable sequential search for enough filtered case by default.
  If the current result is enough filtered, sequential search is faster than index search.
  If the current result has only 1% records of all records in a table and less than 1000 records, sequential search is used even when index search is available.

  Cullently, this optimization is applied when search by ``==``, ``>``, ``<``, ``>=``, or ``<=``.

  When a key of a table that has columns specified by the filter is ``ShortText``, you must set ``NormalizerAuto`` to normalizer of the table to apply this optimization.

  You can disable this feature by ``GRN_TABLE_SELECT_ENOUGH_FILTERED_RATIO=0.0`` environment variable.

* [load] improve error message.
  Table name is included.

* [load] add ``lock_table`` option.
  If ``--lock_table yes`` is specified, ``load`` locks the target table while updating columns and applying ``--each``.
  This option avoids ``load`` and ``delete`` conflicts but it'll reduce load performance.

* [vector_find] avoid to crash with unsupported modes

Fixes
-----

* [index] fix a bug that offline index construction for text vector with ``HASH_KEY``.
  It creates index with invalid section ID.

* Fix a bug that ``--match_columns 'index[0] || index[9]'`` uses wrong section.

* [highlighter] fix a wrong highlight bug
  It's caused when lexicon is hash table and keyword is less than N of N-gram.

* [mruby] fix a bug that real error is hidden.
  mruby doesn't support error propagation by no argument raise.
  https://github.com/mruby/mruby/issues/290

* [:doc:`/reference/tokenizers`][TokenNgram loose]: fix a not found bug when query has only loose types.
  ``highlight_html()`` with lexicon was also broken.

* Fix a bug that text->number cast ignores trailing garbage.
  "0garbage" should be cast error.

* Fix an optimization bug for ``reference_column >= 'key_value'`` case

.. _release-8-0-5:

Release 8.0.5 - 2018-07-29

* [httpd] Updated bundled nginx to 1.15.2.

* [:doc:`/install/ubuntu`] Dropped Ubuntu 17.10 (Artful Aardvark) support.
  It has reached EOL at July 19, 2018.

* [:doc:`/install/debian`] Dropped jessie support.
  Debian's security and release team will no longer produce updates for jessie.

Fixes
-----

* Fixed returning wrong result after unfinished ``/d/load`` data by POST.

* Fixed wrong function call around KyTea.

* [:doc:`/reference/executables/grndb`] Added a missing label for the ``--force-truncate`` option.

* Fixed crash on closing of a database, when a normalizer provided by a plugin (ex. ``groonga-normalizer-mysql``) is used with any option.

* Fixed a bug that normalizer/tokenizer options may be ignored.
  It's occurred when the same object ID is reused.

.. _release-8-0-4:

* [:doc:`/reference/tokenizers`][TokenMecab] Convert error message encoding.

* [:doc:`/reference/window_functions/window_sum`] Supported dynamic column as a target column.

* [doc][:doc:`/reference/api/grn_obj`] Added API reference for ``grn_obj_is_vector_column()``.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/column_create`] Added more validations.

  * 1: Full text search index for vector column must have ``WITH_SECTION`` flag.
    (Note that TokenDelmit with ``WITH_POSITION`` without ``WITH_SECTION`` is permitted.
    It's useful pattern for tag search.)

  * 2: Full text search index for vector column must not be multi column index.
    detail: https://github.com/groonga/groonga/commit/08e2456ba35407e3d5172f71a0200fac2a770142

  If you have been used ``NormalizerNFKC100`` , you must recreate your indexes.

.. _release-8-0-2:

Release 8.0.2 - 2018-04-29
==========================

Improvements

.. _release-8-0-1:

Release 8.0.1 - 2018-03-29
==========================

Improvements
------------

* [:doc:`/reference/log`] Show ``filter`` conditions in query log.
  It's disabled by default. To enable it, you need to set an environment
  variable ``GRN_QUERY_LOG_SHOW_CONDITION=yes``.

* Install ``*.pdb`` into the directory where ``*.dll`` and ``*.exe``
  are installed.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/logical_count`] Support ``filtered``
  stage dynamic columns.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/logical_count`]
  [:ref:`logical-count-post-filter`] Added a new filter timing.
  It's executed after ``filtered`` stage columns are generated.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/logical_select`]
  [:ref:`logical-select-post-filter`] Added a new filter timing.
  It's executed after ``filtered`` stage columns are generated.

* Support LZ4/Zstd/zlib compression for vector data.

* Support alias to accessor such as ``_key``.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/logical_range_filter`] Optimize
  window function for large result set.
  If we find enough matched records, we don't apply window function
  to the remaining windows.

  TODO: Disable this optimization for small result set if its overhead
  is not negligible. The overhead is not evaluated yet.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/select`] Added ``match_escalation`` parameter.
  You can force to enable match escalation by ``--match_escalation yes``.
  It's stronger than ``--match_escalation_threshold 99999....999``
  because ``--match_escalation yes`` also works with
  ``SOME_CONDITIONS && column @ 'query'``.
  ``--match_escalation_threshold`` isn't used in this case.

  The default is ``--match_escalation auto``. It doesn't change the
  current behavior.

  You can disable match escalation by ``--match_escalation no``.
  It's the same as ``--match_escalation_threshold -1``.

* [httpd] Updated bundled nginx to 1.13.10.

Fixes
-----

* Fixed memory leak that occurs when a prefix query doesn't match any token.
  [GitHub#820][Patch by Naoya Murakami]

* Fixed a bug that a cache for different databases is used when
  multiple databases are opened in the same process.

* Fixed a bug that a wrong index is constructed.
  This occurs only when the source of a column is a vector column and
  ``WITH_SECTION`` isn't specified.

* Fixed a bug that a constant value can overflow or underflow in
  comparison (>,>=,<,<=,==,!=).

.. _release-8-0-0:

Release 8.0.0 - 2018-02-09
==========================

This is a major version up! But It keeps backward compatibility.
You can upgrade to 8.0.0 without rebuilding database.

Improvements
------------

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/select`] Added ``--drilldown_adjuster`` and
  ``--drilldowns[LABEL].adjuster``.
  You can adjust score against result of drilldown.

* [:ref:`online-index-construction`] Changed environment variable name
  ``GRN_II_REDUCE_EXPIRE_ENABLE`` to ``GRN_II_REDUCE_EXPIRE_THRESHOLD``.

  ``GRN_II_REDUCE_EXPIRE_THRESHOLD=0 == GRN_II_REDUCE_EXPIRE_ENABLE=no``.
  ``GRN_II_REDUCE_EXPIRE_THRESHOLD=-1`` uses
  ``ii->chunk->max_map_seg / 2`` as threshold.
  ``GRN_II_REDUCE_EXPIRE_THRESHOLD > 0`` uses
  ``MIN(ii->chunk->max_map_seg / 2, GRN_II_REDUCE_EXPIRE_THRESHOLD)``
  as threshold.
  ``GRN_II_REDUCE_EXPIRE_THRESHOLD=32`` is the default.

* [:doc:`/reference/functions/between`] Accept ``between()`` without borders.
  If the number of arguments passed to ``between()`` is 3, the 2nd and 3rd
  arguments are handled as the inclusive edges. [GitHub#685]

Fixes
-----

* Fixed a memory leak for normal hash table.
  [GitHub:mroonga/mroonga#190][Reported by fuku1]

* Fix a memory leak for normal array.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/select`] Stopped to cache when ``output_columns``
  uses not stable function.

* [Windows] Fixed wrong value report on ``WSASend`` error.

.. _release-7-1-1:

Release 7.1.1 - 2018-01-29
==========================

Improvements
------------

* [:doc:`/install/ubuntu`] Dropped Ubuntu 17.04 (Zesty Zapus) support.
  It has reached EOL at Jan 13, 2018.

* Added quorum match support.
  You can use quorum match in both script syntax and query syntax.
  [groonga-talk,385][Suggested by 付超群]

  TODO: Add documents for quorum match syntax and link to them.

* Added custom similarity threshold support in script syntax.
  You can use custom similarity threshold in script syntax.

  TODO: Add document for the syntax and link to it.

* [:doc:`/reference/executables/grndb`][:ref:`grndb-force-lock-clear`]
  Added ``--force-lock-clear`` option. With this option, ``grndb``
  forces to clear locks of database, tables and data columns. You can
  use your database again even if locks are remained in database,
  tables and data columns.

  But this option very risky. Normally, you should not use it. If your
  database is broken, your database is still broken. This option just
  ignores locks.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/load`] Added surrogate pairs support in
  escape syntax. For example, ``\uD83C\uDF7A`` is processed as ``🍺``.

* [Windows] Changed to use sparse file on Windows. It reduces disk
  space and there are no performance demerit.

* [:ref:`online-index-construction`] Added
  ``GRN_II_REDUCE_EXPIRE_THRESHOLD`` environment variable to control
  when memory maps are expired in index column. It's ``-1`` by
  default. It means that expire timing is depends on index column
  size. If index column is smaller, expire timing is more. If index
  column is larger, expire timing is less.

  You can use the previous behavior by ``0``. It means that Groonga
  always tries to expire.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/logical_range_filter`]
  [:ref:`logical-range-filter-post-filter`] Added a new filter timing.
  It's executed after ``filtered`` stage generated columns are generated.

Fixes
-----

* Reduced resource usage for creating index for reference vector.
  [GitHub#806][Reported by Naoya Murakami]

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/table_create`] Fixed a bug that a table
  is created even when ``token_filters`` is invalid.
  [GitHub#266]

    * outputs number of deleted and error records.
    * outputs number of rest number of records.

* [:doc:`/reference/executables/groonga-server-http`] The server
  executed by ``groonga -s`` ensure stopping by C-c.

* Used ``NaN`` and ``Infinity``, ``-Infinity`` instead of Lisp
  representations(``#<nan>`` and  ``#i1/0``, ``#-i1/0``).

* Supported vector for drilldown calc target.

* Partially supported keyword extraction from regexp search.
  It enables ``highlight_html`` and ``snippet_html`` for regexp search.
  [GitHub#787][Reported by takagi01]

* [bulk] Reduced the number of ``realloc()``.
  ``grn_bulk_*()`` API supports it.

  It improves performance for large output case on Windows.
  For example, it causes 100x faster for 100MB over output.

  Because ``realloc()`` is heavy on Windows.

* Enabled ``GRN_II_OVERLAP_TOKEN_SKIP_ENABLE`` only when its value is "yes".

* Deprecated ``GRN_NGRAM_TOKENIZER_REMOVE_BLANK_DISABLE``.
  Use ``GRN_NGRAM_TOKENIZER_REMOVE_BLANK_ENABLE=no`` instead.

  It'll improve performance for getter of fixed size column value.

* [:doc:`/reference/executables/groonga`] Added ``--listen-backlog option``.
  You can customize ``listen(2)``'s backlog by this option.

* [httpd] Updated bundled nginx to 1.13.8.

Fixes
-----

* Fixed a memory leak in ``highlight_full``

* Fixed a crash bug by early unlink
  It's not caused by instruction in ``grn_expr_parse()`` but it's caused when
  libgroonga user such as Mroonga uses the following instructions:

    1. ``grn_expr_append_const("_id")``
    2. ``grn_expr_append_op(GRN_OP_GET_VALUE)``

  named parameters.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/select`] Supported ``--match_columns _key``
  without index.

* [:doc:`/reference/functions/in_values`] Supported to specify more
  than 126 values. [GitHub#760] [GitHub#781] [groonga-dev,04449]

.. _release-7-0-8:

Release 7.0.8 - 2017-10-29
==========================

Improvements
------------

* [windows] Supported backtrace on crash.
  This feature not only function call history but also source filename
  and number of lines can be displayed as much as possible.
  This feature makes problem solving easier.

* Supported ``( )`` (empty block) only query (``--query "( )"``) for
  ``QUERY_NO_SYNTAX_ERROR``. In the previous version, it caused an
  error. [GitHub#767]

* Supported ``(+)`` (only and block) only query (``--query "(+)"``)
  for ``QUERY_NO_SYNTAX_ERROR``. In the previous version, it caused an
  error. [GitHub#767]

* Supported ``~foo`` (starting with "~") query (``--query "~y"``) for
  ``QUERY_NO_SYNTAX_ERROR``. In the previous version, it caused an
  error. [GitHub#767]

* Modified log level of ``expired`` from ``info`` to ``debug``.
  ``2017-10-29 14:05:34.123456|i| <0000000012345678:0> expired
  i=000000000B123456 max=10 (2/2)`` This message is logged when memory
  mapped area for index is unmapped.  Thus, this log message is useful
  information for debugging, in other words, as it is unnecessary
  information in normal operation, we changed log level from ``info``
  to ``debug``.

* Supported Ubuntu 17.10 (Artful Aardvark)

Fixes
-----

* [dat] Fixed a bug that large file is created unexpectedly in the
  worst case during database expansion process. This bug may occurs
  when you create/delete index columns so frequently. In 7.0.7
  release, a related bug was fixed - "``table_create`` command fails
  when there are many deleted keys", but it turns out that it is not
  enough in the worst case.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/logical_select`] Fixed a bug that when
  ``offset`` and ``limit`` were applied to multiple shards at the same
  time, there is a case that it returns a fewer number of records
  unexpectedly.

.. _release-7-0-7:

Release 7.0.7 - 2017-09-29
==========================

Improvements
------------

* Supported ``+`` only query (``--query "+"``) for
  ``QUERY_NO_SYNTAX_ERROR``. In the previous version, it caused an
  error.

* [httpd] Updated bundled nginx to 1.13.5.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/dump`] Added the default argument values
  to the syntax section.

* [:doc:`/reference/command/command_version`] Supported ``--default-command-version 3``.

* Supported caching select result with function call. Now, most of
  existing functions supports this feature. There are two exception,
  when ``now()`` and ``rand()`` are used in query, select result will
  not cached. Because of this default behavior change, new APIs are
  introduced.

  * ``grn_proc_set_is_stable()``
  * ``grn_proc_is_stable()``

  Note that if you add a new function that may return different result
  with the same argument, you must call ``grn_proc_is_stable(ctx,
  proc, GRN_FALSE)``.  If you don't call it, select result with the
  function call is cached and is wrong result for multiple requests.

Fixes
-----

* [windows] Fixed to clean up file handle correctly on failure when
  ``database_unmap`` is executed. There is a case that critical
  section is not initialized when request is canceled before executing
  ``database_unmap``. In such a case, it caused a crach bug.

* [:doc:`/reference/tokenizers`] Fixed document for wrong tokenizer
  names. It should be ``TokenBigramIgnoreBlankSplitSymbolAlpha`` and
  ``TokenBigramIgnoreBlankSplitSymbolAlphaDigit``.

* Changed not to keep created empty file on error.

  In the previous versions, there is a case that empty file keeps
  remain on error.

  Here is the senario to reproduce:

    1. creating new file by grn_fileinfo_open succeeds
    2. mapping file by DO_MAP() is failed

  In such a case, it causes an another error such as
  "already file exists" because of the file which
  isn't under control. so these file should be removed during
  cleanup process.

* Fixed a bug that Groonga may be crashed when search process is
  executed during executing many updates in a short time.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/table_create`] Fixed a bug that
  ``table_create`` failed when there are many deleted keys.

.. _release-7-0-6:

Release 7.0.6 - 2017-08-29
==========================

Improvements
------------

* Supported prefix match search using multiple
  indexes. (e.g. ``--query "Foo*" --match_columns
  "TITLE_INDEX_COLUMN||BODY_INDEX_COLUMN"``).

* [:doc:`/reference/window_functions/window_count`] Supported
  ``window_count`` function to add count data to result set. It is
  useful to analyze or filter additionally.

* Added the following API

  * ``grn_obj_get_disk_usage():``
  * ``GRN_EXPR_QUERY_NO_SYNTAX_ERROR``
  * ``grn_expr_syntax_expand_query_by_table()``
  * ``grn_table_find_reference_object()``

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/object_inspect`] Supported to show disk
  usage about specified object.

* Supported falling back query parse feature. It is enabled when
  ``QUERY_NO_SYNTAX_ERROR`` flag is set to ``query_flags``. (this
  feature is disabled by default). If this flag is set, query never
  causes syntax error. For example, "A +" is parsed and escaped
  automatically into "A \+". This behavior is useful when application
  uses user input directly and doesn't want to show syntax error to
  user and in log.

* Supported to adjust score for term in query. ">", "<", and "~"
  operators are supported. For example, ">Groonga" increments score of
  "Groonga", "<Groonga" decrements score of "Groonga". "~Groonga"
  decreases score of matched document in the current search
  result. "~" operator doesn't change search result itself.

* Improved performance to remove table. ``thread_limit=1`` is not
  needed for it. The process about checking referenced table existence
  is done without opening objects. As a result, performance is
  improved.

* [httpd] Updated bundled nginx to 1.13.4.

Fixes
-----

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/dump`] Fixed a bug that the 7-th unnamed
  parameter for `--sort_hash_table` option is ignored.

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/schema`] Fixed a typo in command line
  parameter name. It should be `source` instead of `sources`.
  [groonga-dev,04449] [Reported by murata satoshi]

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/ruby_eval`] Fixed crash when ruby_eval
  returned syntax error. [GitHub#751] [Patch by ryo-pinus]

  redundant empty string ``""`` on error. [GitHub#730]

* [functions/time] Supported to show error message when division by
  zero was happened. [GitHub#733] [Patch by Naoya Murakami]

* [windows] Changed to map ``ERROR_NO_SYSTEM_RESOURCES`` to
  ``GRN_RESOURCE_TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE``. In the previous versions,
  it returns ``rc=-1`` as a result code. It is not helpful to
  investigate what actually happened. With this fix, it returns
  ``rc=-12``.

* [functions/min][functions/max] Supported vector column. Now you need
  not to care scalar column or vector column to use. [GitHub#735]
  [Patch by Naoya Murakami]

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/dump`] Supported ``--sort_hash_table``
  option to sort by ``_key`` for hash table. Specify
  ``--sort_hash_table yes`` to use it.

* [:doc:`/reference/functions/between`] Supported to specify index
  column. [GitHub#740] [Patch by Naoya Murakami]

* [load] Supported Apache Arrow 0.5.0 or later.

* [:doc:`/install/ubuntu`] Dropped Ubuntu 16.10 (Yakkety
  Yak) support. It has reached EOL at July 20, 2017.

Fixes
-----

* Fixed to construct correct fulltext indexes against vector column
  which type belongs to text family (```ShortText`` and so on). This
  fix resolves that fulltext search doesn't work well against text
  vector column after updating indexes. [GitHub#494]

* [:doc:`/reference/commands/thread_limit`] Fixed a bug that deadlock
  occurs when thread_limit?max=1 is requested at once.

* [:doc:`/reference/executables/groonga-httpd`] Fixed a mismatch path
  of pid file between default one and restart command assumed. This
  mismatch blocked restarting groonga-httpd. [GitHub#743] [Reported by
  sozaki]

  ``record_number`` as deprecated. Use ``window_record_number``
  instead. ``record_number`` is still available for backward
  compatibility.

* Fixed a bug that access to nonexistent sub records for group causes
  a crash.  For example, This bug affects the case when you use
  ``drilldowns[LABEL].sort_keys _sum`` without specifying
  ``calc_types``.  [Patch by Naoya Murakami] [GitHub#625]

* Fixed a crash bug when tokenizer has an error. It's caused when
  tokenizer and token filter are registered and tokenizer has an
  error.
