geo_distance
============

Summary
-------

``geo_distance`` calculates the value of distance between specified two points.

Syntax
------

``geo_distance`` requires two point.
The parameter ``approximate_type`` is optional::

    geo_distance(point1, point2)
    geo_distance(point1, point2, approximate_type)

The default value of ``approximate_type`` is "rectangle".
If you omit ``approximate_type``, ``geo_distance`` calculates the value of
distance as if "rectangle" was specified.

Return value
------------

``geo_distance`` returns the value of distance in float type.
The unit of return value is meter.

Usage
-----

This section explains geo_distance.
``geo_distance`` is one of the groonga builtin functions.

You can call a builtin function in :doc:`/reference/grn_expr` 

``geo_distance`` function calculates the value of distance(approximate value)
between the coordinate of ``point1`` and the coordinate of ``point2``.

.. note::

    groonga provides three built in functions for calculating the value of distance. 
    There are geo_distance(), geo_distance2() and geo_distance3().
    The difference of them is the algorithm of calculating distance.
    geo_distance2() and geo_distance3() were deprecated since version 1.2.9.
    Use ``geo_distance(point1, point2, "sphere")`` instead of ``geo_distance2(point1, point2)``.
    Use ``geo_distance(point1, point2, "ellipsoid")`` instead of ``geo_distance3(point1, point2)``.

Simple usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Lets's learn about ``geo_distance`` usage with examples.
This section shows simple usages.

Here are two schema definition and sample data to show usage.
Those samples show how to calculate the value of distance between Tokyo and Sapporo.

#. Using the column value of location for calculating the distance (``Station`` table)
#. Using the explicitly specified value of location for calculating the distance (``Geo`` table)

Using the column value of location

Parameters
----------

Required parameter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two required parameter, ``point1`` and ``point2``.

``point1``
""""""""""

It specifies the start point that
you want to calculate the value of distance between two points.

You can specify the value of GeoPoint type. [#]_

``point2``
""""""""""

It specifies the end point that
you want to calculate the value of distance between two points.

You can specify the value of GeoPoint type or 
the string indicating the coordinate.

Optional parameter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is a optional parameter, ``approximate_type``.

``approximate_type``
""""""""""""""""""""

It specifies how to approximate the geographical features for calculating
the value of distance.

You can specify the value of ``approximate_type`` by one of the followings.

  * ``rectangle``
  * ``sphere``
  * ``ellipsoid``

.. note::

    There is a limitation about geo_distance. geo_distance can not calculate the value of distance between two points across meridian nor equator. This is temporary limitation according to the implementation of groonga, but it will be fixed in the future release.

.. note::

    There is a limitation about geo_distance above notice. But it relaxes the limitation if you use ``rectangle`` as approximate type. You can calculate the correct distance if two point are placed at northern hemisphere.

``rectangle``
...............

This parameter require to approximate the geographical features
by square approximation.

Since the value of distance is calculated by simple formula,
you can calculate the value of distance fast.
But, the error of distance increases as it approaches the pole.

You can also specify ``rect`` as abbrev expression.

Here is a sample about calculating the value of distance with column value.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/functions/geo_distance_location_rectangle.log

Here is a sample about calculating the value of distance with explicitly specified point.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/functions/geo_distance_distance_rectangle.log

.. note::

    ``geo_distance`` uses square approximation as default. If you omit ``approximate_type``, ``geo_distance`` behaves like ``rectangle`` was specified.

``sphere``
...............

This parameter require to approximate the geographical features
by spherical approximation.

It is slower than ``rectangle``, but the error of distance becomes
smaller than ``rectangle``.

You can also specify ``sphr`` as abbrev expression.

Here is a sample about calculating the value of distance with column value.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/functions/geo_distance_location_sphere.log

Here is a sample about calculating the value of distance with explicitly specified point.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/functions/geo_distance_distance_sphere.log

``ellipsoid``
...............

This parameter require to approximate the geographical features
by ellipsoid approximation.

It uses the calculation of distance by the formula of Hubeny.
It is slower than ``sphere``, but the error of distance becomes
smaller than ``sphere``.

You can also specify ``ellip`` as abbrev expression.

Here is a sample about calculating the value of distance with column value.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/functions/geo_distance_location_ellipsoid.log

Here is a sample about calculating the value of distance with explicitly specified point.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../example/functions/geo_distance_distance_ellipsoid.log

.. rubric:: Footnote

.. [#] You can specify whether TokyoGeoPoint or WGS84GeoPoint.
