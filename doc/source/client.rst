Client
======

Groonga supports the original protocol (:doc:`/spec/gqtp`), the memcached
binary protocol and HTTP.

As HTTP and memcached binary protocol is matured protocol, you can use
existing client libraries.

There are some client libraries which provides convenient API to connect
to Groonga server in some program languages. See `Client libraries
<http://groonga.org/related-projects.html#libraries>`_ for details.
