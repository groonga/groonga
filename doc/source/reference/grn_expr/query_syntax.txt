Query syntax
============

Query syntax is a syntax to specify search condition for common Web
search form. It is similar to the syntax of Google's search form. For
example, ``word1 word2`` means that groonga searches records that
contain both ``word1`` and ``word2``. ``word1 OR word2`` means that
groogna searches records that contain either ``word1`` or ``word2``.

Query syntax consists of ``conditional expression``, ``combind
expression`` and ``assignment expression``. Nomrally ``assignment
expression`` can be ignored. Because ``assignment expression`` is
disabled in ``--query`` option of :doc:`/commands/select`. You can use
it if you use groonga as library and customize query syntax parser
options.

``Conditinal expression`` specifies an condition. ``Combinded
expression`` consists of one or more ``conditional expression``,
``combined expression`` or ``assignment expression``. ``Assignment
expression`` can assigns a column to a value.

Sample data
-----------

Here are a schema definition and sample data to show usage.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../../example/reference/grn_expr/query_syntax/setup.log
.. table_create Entries TABLE_PAT_KEY ShortText
.. column_create Entries content COLUMN_SCALAR Text
.. column_create Entries n_likes COLUMN_SCALAR UInt32
.. table_create Terms TABLE_PAT_KEY|KEY_NORMALIZE ShortText --default_tokenizer TokenBigram
.. column_create Terms entries_key_index COLUMN_INDEX|WITH_POSITION Entries _key
.. column_create Terms entries_content_index COLUMN_INDEX|WITH_POSITION Entries content
.. load --table Entries
.. [
.. {"_key":    "The first post!",
..  "content": "Welcome! This is my first post!",
..  "n_likes": 5},
.. {"_key":    "Groonga",
..  "content": "I started to use groonga. It's very fast!",
..  "n_likes": 10},
.. {"_key":    "Mroonga",
..  "content": "I also started to use mroonga. It's also very fast! Really fast!",
..  "n_likes": 15},
.. {"_key":    "Good-bye Senna",
..  "content": "I migrated all Senna system!",
..  "n_likes": 3},
.. {"_key":    "Good-bye Tritonn",
..  "content": "I also migrated all Tritonn system!",
..  "n_likes": 3}
.. ]

There is a table, ``Entries``, for blog entries. An entry has title,
content and the number of likes for the entry. Title is key of
``Entries``. Content is value of ``Entries.content`` column. The
number of likes is value of ``Entries.n_likes`` column.

``Entries._key`` column and ``Entries.content`` column are indexed
using ``TokenBigram`` tokenizer. So both ``Entries._key`` and
``Entries.content`` are fulltext search ready.

OK. The schema and data for examples are ready.

Escape
------

There are special characters in query syntax. To use a special
character as itself, it should be escaped by prepending ``\``. For
example, ``"`` is a special character. It is escaped as ``\"``.

Here is a special character list:

  * `` `` (a space) (escaped as ``\ ``)
  * ``"`` (escaped as ``\"``)
  * ``'`` (escaped as ``\'``)
  * ``(`` (escaped as ``\(``)
  * ``)`` (escaped as ``\)``)
  * ``\`` (escaped as ``\\``)

You can use quote instead of escape. Quote's syntax is ``"..."`` or
``'...'``. You need escape ``"`` as ``\"`` in ``"..."`` quote syntax.
You need escape ``'`` as ``\'`` in ``'...'`` quote syntax. For
example, ``Alice's brother (Bob)`` can be quoted ``"Alice's brother
(Bob)"`` or ``'Alice\'s brother (Bob)'``.

Conditional expression
----------------------

Here is available conditional expression list.

Full text search condition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Its syntax is ``keyword``.

``Full text search condition`` specifies a full text search condition
against the default match columns. Match columns are full text search
target columns.

You should specify the default match columns for full text
search. They can be specified by ``--match_columns`` option of
:doc:`/commands/select`. If you don't specify the default match
columns, this conditional expression fails.

This conditional expression does full text search with
``keyword``. ``keyword`` should not contain any spaces. If ``keyword``
contains a space such as ``search keyword``, it means two full text
search conditions; ``search`` and ``keyword``. If you want to
specifies a keyword that contains one or more spaces, you can use
``phrase search condition`` that is described below.

Here is a simple exmaple.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../../example/reference/grn_expr/query_syntax/simple_full_text_search.log
.. select Entries --match_columns content --query fast

The expression matches records that contain a word ``fast`` in
``content`` column value.

``content`` column is the default match column.

Phrase search condition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Its syntax is ``"search keyword"``.

``Phrase search condition`` specifies a phrase search condition
against the default match columns.

You should specify the default match columns for full text
search. They can be specified by ``--match_columns`` option of
:doc:`/commands/select`. If you don't specify the default match
columns, this conditional expression fails.

This conditional expression does phrase search with ``search
keyword``. Phrase search searches records that contain ``search`` and
``keyword`` and those terms are appeared in the same order and
adjacent. Thus, ``Put a search keyword in the form`` is matched but
``Search by the keyword`` and ``There is a keyword. Search by it!``
aren't matched.

Here is a simple exmaple.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../../example/reference/grn_expr/query_syntax/simple_phrase_search.log
.. select Entries --match_columns content --query '"I started"'

The expression matches records that contain a phrase ``I started`` in
``content`` column value. ``I also started`` isn't matched because
``I`` and ``started`` aren't adjacent.

``content`` column is the default match column.

Full text search condition (with explicit match column)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Its syntax is ``column:@keyword``.

It's similar to ``full text search condition`` but it doesn't require
the default match columns. You need to specify match column for the
full text search condition by ``column:`` instead of
``--match_columns`` option of :doc:`/commands/select`.

This condtional expression is useful when you want to use two or more
full text search against different columns. The default match columns
specified by ``--match_columns`` option can't be specified multiple
times. You need to specify the second match column by this conditional
expression.

The different between ``full text search condition`` and ``full text
search condition (with explicit match column)`` is whether advanced
match columns are supported or not. ``Full text search condition``
supports advanced match columns but ``full text search condition (with
explicit match column)`` isn't supported. Advanced match columns has
the following features:

  * Weight is supported.
  * Using multiple columns are supported.
  * Using index column as a match column is supported.

See description of ``--match_columns`` option of
:doc:`/commands/select` about them.

Here is a simple exmaple.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../../example/reference/grn_expr/query_syntax/simple_full_text_search_with_explicit_match_column.log
.. select Entries --query content:@fast

The expression matches records that contain a word ``fast`` in
``content`` column value.

Phrase search condition (with explicit match column)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Its syntax is ``column:@"search keyword"``.

It's similar to ``phrase search condition`` but it doesn't require the
default match columns. You need to specify match column for the phrase
search condition by ``column:`` instead of ``--match_columns`` option
of :doc:`/commands/select`.

The different between ``phrase search condition`` and ``phrase search
condition (with explicit match column)`` is similar to between ``full
text search condition`` and ``full text search condition (with
explicit match column)``. ``Phrase search condition`` supports
advanced match columns but ``phrase search condition (with explicit
match column)`` isn't supported. See description of ``full text search
condition (with explicit match column)`` about advanced match columns.

Here is a simple exmaple.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../../example/reference/grn_expr/query_syntax/simple_phrase_search_with_explicit_match_column.log
.. select Entries --query 'content:@"I started"'

The expression matches records that contain a phrase ``I started`` in
``content`` column value. ``I also started`` isn't matched because
``I`` and ``started`` aren't adjacent.

Prefix search condition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Its syntax is ``column:^value`` or ``value*``.

This conditional expression does prefix search with ``value``. Prefix
search searches records that contain a word that starts with ``value``.

To use fast prefix search, you need to use patricia trie table
(``TABLE_PAT_KEY``) or double array trie table
(``TABLE_DAT_KEY``). You can use prefix search against ``_key`` value
of patricia trie table or double trie trie table.

Prefix search can be used with other table types but it causes all
records scan. It's not problem for small records but it spends more
time for large records.

It doesn't require the default match columns such as ``full text
search condition`` and ``phrase search condition``.

Here is a simple exmaple.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../../example/reference/grn_expr/query_syntax/simple_prefix_search.log
.. select Entries --query '_key:^Goo'

The expression matches records that contain a word that starts with
``Goo`` in ``_key`` pseudo column value. ``Good-bye Senna`` and
``Good-bye Tritonn`` are matched with the expression.

Suffix search condition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Its syntax is ``column:$value``.

This conditional expression does suffix search with ``value``. Suffix
search searches records that contain a word that ends with ``value``.

To use fast suffix search, you need to use patricia trie table
(``TABLE_PAT_KEY``) with ``KEY_WITH_SIS`` flag. You can use suffix
search against ``_key`` value of patricia trie table.

Suffix search can be used with other table types or patricia trie
table without ``KEY_WITH_SIS`` flag but it causes all records
scan. It's not problem for small records but it spends more time for
large records.

It doesn't require the default match columns such as ``full text
search condition`` and ``phrase search condition``.

Here is a simple exmaple.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../../example/reference/grn_expr/query_syntax/simple_suffix_search.log
.. table_create Titles TABLE_PAT_KEY|KEY_WITH_SIS ShortText
.. load --table Titles
.. [
.. {"_key": "The first post!"},
.. {"_key": "Groonga"},
.. {"_key": "Mroonga"},
.. {"_key": "Good-bye Senna"},
.. {"_key": "Good-bye Tritonn"}
.. ]
.. select Titles --query '_key:$oonga'

The expression matches records that contain a word that ends with
``oonga`` in ``_key`` pseudo column value. ``Groonga`` and
``Mroonga`` are matched with the expression.

Equal condition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Its syntax is ``column:value``.

It matches records that ``column`` value is equal to ``value``.

It doesn't require the default match columns such as ``full text
search condition`` and ``phrase search condition``.

Here is a simple exmaple.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../../example/reference/grn_expr/query_syntax/simple_equal.log
.. select Entries --query _key:Groonga

The expression matches records that ``_key`` column value is
equal to ``Groonga``.

Not equal condition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Its syntax is ``column:!value``.

It matches records that ``column`` value isn't equal to ``value``.

It doesn't require the default match columns such as ``full text
search condition`` and ``phrase search condition``.

Here is a simple exmaple.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../../example/reference/grn_expr/query_syntax/simple_not_equal.log
.. select Entries --query _key:!Groonga

The expression matches records that ``_key`` column value is not equal
to ``Groonga``.

Less than condition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Its syntax is ``column:<value``.

It matches records that ``column`` value is less than ``value``.

If ``column`` type is numerical type such as ``Int32``, ``column``
value and ``value`` are compared as number. If ``column`` type is text
type such as ``ShortText``, ``column`` value and ``value`` are
compared as bit sequence.

It doesn't require the default match columns such as ``full text
search condition`` and ``phrase search condition``.

Here is a simple exmaple.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../../example/reference/grn_expr/query_syntax/simple_less_than.log
.. select Entries --query n_likes:<10

The expression matches records that ``n_likes`` column value is less
than ``10``.

Greater than condition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Its syntax is ``column:>value``.

It matches records that ``column`` value is greater than ``value``.

If ``column`` type is numerical type such as ``Int32``, ``column``
value and ``value`` are compared as number. If ``column`` type is text
type such as ``ShortText``, ``column`` value and ``value`` are
compared as bit sequence.

It doesn't require the default match columns such as ``full text
search condition`` and ``phrase search condition``.

Here is a simple exmaple.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../../example/reference/grn_expr/query_syntax/simple_greater_than.log
.. select Entries --query n_likes:>10

The expression matches records that ``n_likes`` column value is greater
than ``10``.

Less than or equal to condition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Its syntax is ``column:<=value``.

It matches records that ``column`` value is less than or equal to
``value``.

If ``column`` type is numerical type such as ``Int32``, ``column``
value and ``value`` are compared as number. If ``column`` type is text
type such as ``ShortText``, ``column`` value and ``value`` are
compared as bit sequence.

It doesn't require the default match columns such as ``full text
search condition`` and ``phrase search condition``.

Here is a simple exmaple.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../../example/reference/grn_expr/query_syntax/simple_less_than_or_equal_to.log
.. select Entries --query n_likes:<=10

The expression matches records that ``n_likes`` column value is less
than or equal to ``10``.

Greater than or equal to condition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Its syntax is ``column:>=value``.

It matches records that ``column`` value is greater than or equal to
``value``.

If ``column`` type is numerical type such as ``Int32``, ``column``
value and ``value`` are compared as number. If ``column`` type is text
type such as ``ShortText``, ``column`` value and ``value`` are
compared as bit sequence.

It doesn't require the default match columns such as ``full text
search condition`` and ``phrase search condition``.

Here is a simple exmaple.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../../example/reference/grn_expr/query_syntax/simple_greater_than_or_equal_to.log
.. select Entries --query n_likes:>=10

The expression matches records that ``n_likes`` column value is
greater than or equal to ``10``.

Combined expression
-------------------

Here is available combined expression list.

Logical OR
^^^^^^^^^^

Its syntax is ``a OR b``.

``a`` and ``b`` are conditional expressions, conbinded expressions or
assignment expressions.

If at least one of ``a`` and ``b`` are matched, ``a OR b`` is matched.

Here is a simple exmaple.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../../example/reference/grn_expr/query_syntax/simple_logical_or.log
.. select Entries --query 'n_likes:>10 OR content:@senna'

The expression matches records that ``n_likes`` column value is
greater than ``10`` or contain a word ``senna`` in ``content`` column
value.

Logical AND
^^^^^^^^^^^

Its syntax is ``a + b`` or just ``a b``.

``a`` and ``b`` are conditional expressions, conbinded expressions or
assignment expressions.

If both ``a`` and ``b`` are matched, ``a + b`` is matched.

You can specify ``+`` the first expression such as ``+a``. The ``+``
is just ignored.

Here is a simple exmaple.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../../example/reference/grn_expr/query_syntax/simple_logical_and.log
.. select Entries --query 'n_likes:>=10 + content:@groonga'

The expression matches records that ``n_likes`` column value is
greater than or equal to ``10`` and contain a word ``groonga`` in
``content`` column value.

Logical NOT
^^^^^^^^^^^

Its syntax is ``a - b``.

``a`` and ``b`` are conditional expressions, conbinded expressions or
assignment expressions.

If ``a`` is matched and ``b`` is not matched, ``a - b`` is matched.

You can not specify ``-`` the first expression such as ``-a``. It's
syntax error.

Here is a simple exmaple.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../../example/reference/grn_expr/query_syntax/simple_logical_not.log
.. select Entries --query 'n_likes:>=10 - content:@groonga'

The expression matches records that ``n_likes`` column value is
greater than or equal to ``10`` and don't contain a word ``groonga`` in
``content`` column value.

Grouping
^^^^^^^^

Its syntax is ``(...)``. ``...`` is space separated expression list.

``(...)`` groups one ore more expressions and they can be
processed as an expression. ``a b OR c`` means that ``a`` and ``b``
are matched or ``c`` is matched. ``a (b OR c)`` means that ``a`` and
one of ``b`` and ``c`` are matched.

Here is a simple exmaple.

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../../example/reference/grn_expr/query_syntax/simple_grouping.log
.. select Entries --query 'n_likes:<5 content:@senna OR content:@fast'
.. select Entries --query 'n_likes:<5 (content:@senna OR content:@fast)'

The first expression doesn't use grouping. It matches records that
``n_likes:<5`` and ``content:@senna`` are matched or
``content:@fast`` is matched.

The second expression uses grouping. It matches records that
``n_likes:<5`` and one of ``content:@senna`` or ``content:@fast``
are matched.

Assignment expression
---------------------

This section is for advanced users. Because assignment expression is
disabled in ``--query`` option of :doc:`/commands/select`. You need to
use groonga as a library instead of server or command line tool for
assignment expression.

Assignment expression in query syntax has some limitations. So you
should use :doc:`/reference/grn_expr/script_syntax` instead of query syntax for
assignment.

There is only one syntax for assignment expression. It's ``column:=value``.

``value`` is assigend to ``column``. ``value`` is always processed as
string in query syntax. ``value`` is casted to the type of ``column``
automatically. It causes some limitations. For example, you cannot use
boolean literal such as ``true`` and ``false`` for ``Bool`` type
column. You need to use empty string for ``false`` but query syntax
doesn't support ``column:=`` syntax.

See :doc:`/reference/cast` about cast.
