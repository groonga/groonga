.. _note:

   You don't need to resolve scoring only by score function. Score
   function is highly depends on search query. You may be able to use
   metadata of matched record.

   For example, Google uses `PageRank
   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank>`_ for scoring. You may be
   able to use data type ("title" data are important rather than
   "memo" data), tag, geolocation and so on.

   Please stop to think about only score function for scoring.
